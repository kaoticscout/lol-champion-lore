Such is the case with {{ci|Jax}}, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War.\n\nBefore joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.\n\nHis Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began. Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the [[Fields of Justice]]. The self-proclaimed 'Armsmaster of the League' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched.\n\nA number of [[summoner]]s in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable.\n\nFor this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under.\n\nThis was something the League had never done before, and something which has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways.\n\nThe League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n", "title": "Grandmaster at Arms"}, "Shaco": {"key": "Shaco", "id": 35, "name": "Shaco", "background": "Male\n|race       = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = * Homicidal Jester\n|faction    = * Independent\n|allies     =\n|friends    = Fiddlesticks, Nocturne\n|rivals     =\n|related    =\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Demon Jester"}, "Warwick": {"key": "Warwick", "id": 19, "name": "Warwick", "background": "Male\n|race = Werewolf &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = \n* Manhunter\n* Researcher\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Singed\n|rivals = Vayne\n|enemies = Soraka\n|related = \n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Eventually the beast catches up with all of us.&quot;'' - {{ci|Warwick}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWarwick was once a man revered for his ability to {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|track down}} human specimens for the darkest types of scientific research. When {{ai|Eternal Thirst|Warwick|his ambitions}} exceeded his physical limits, he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself into an unstoppable {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|manhunter}}. His newfound strength bore a heavy price.\n\nBefore his transformation, Warwick found his calling in [[Zaun]] as a 'procurer' of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner.\n\nTo meet their demands, Warwick needed the strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend, {{ci|Singed}}, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the [[Shadow Isles]], the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge.\n\nHe traveled to [[Ionia]] to trap {{ci|Soraka}}, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|raw strength}} and {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|heightened senses}}.\n\nExhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power. Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further away. He could feel himself losing control: though he always got his prey, he often failed to bring them back alive. Now he seeks the blood of Soraka to stabilize his transformation before his mind gives way to the {{ai|Hunter's Call|Warwick|feral urges}} of the beast.\n\n", "title": "the Blood Hunter"}, "Nidalee": {"key": "Nidalee", "id": 76, "name": "Nidalee", "background": "Female\n|render      = [[File:Nidalee_Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|race        = Half-human, half-feline &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Hybrid transfiguring entity)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace  = Unknown\n|residence   = [[Kumungu]]\n|faction     = * Independent\n|friends     = Udyr\n|rivals      = Rengar\n|related     =\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Bestial Huntress"}, "Zyra": {"key": "Zyra", "id": 143, "name": "Zyra", "background": "* {{ai|Deadly Spines|Zyra|Thorn Spitter}}\n* {{ai|Grasping Roots|Zyra|Vine Lasher}}\n|render = Zyra Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = {{ai|Stranglethorns|Zyra}} &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Fused with Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Kumungu]]\n|residence = \n|occupation = Predator\n|faction = \n* Independent \n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Maokai\n|related = \n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Closer to the flower, closer to the thorns.&quot;'' - {{ci|Zyra}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLonging to take control of her fate, the ancient, dying plant Zyra transferred her consciousness into a human body for a second chance at life.\n\nCenturies ago, she and her kind dominated the [[Kumungu]] Jungle, using {{ai|Deadly Spines|Zyra|thorns}} and {{ai|Grasping Roots|Zyra|vines}} to consume any animal that set foot in their territory. As the years passed, the animal population steadily died off.\n\nFood became increasingly scarce, and Zyra could only stand by helplessly as the last of her kind withered away. She thought she would perish alone, until the appearance of an unwary sorceress presented her with an opportunity for salvation.\n\nIt was the first time in years Zyra had sensed a creature wander so close. Hunger drew her to the sorceress, but some other, deeper instinct compelled her.\n\nShe {{ai|Grasping Roots|Zyra|enveloped}} the woman in thorns with ease, but as she savored this final meal, foreign memories invaded her thoughts. She saw great jungles of metal and stone where humans and animals thrived. Potent magic surged through her vines, and she devised an elegant but risky plan to survive.\n\nUsing the woman's memories, Zyra poured her newfound magic into the creation of a human-shaped vessel. She didn't know [[Runeterra|what sort of world]] awaited her, but she had nothing left to lose.\n\nWhen Zyra opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed by the raw power ready at her fingertips. It wasn't until she noticed the shriveled remains of {{ai|Stranglethorns|Zyra|the plant she once was}} that she realized how vulnerable she had become.\n\nIf this body died, there would be no network of vines to retreat through, no roots to regrow her... but she felt truly alive.

As was his people's way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. \n\nTrekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered in ancient runes. Though the meaning of the runes was long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. Inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren's song, captivating and seductive. \n\nWhile the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his hand...\n\n[[File:Kegan Rodhe.jpg|center|400px]]\n\nThat is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand. It is a creature of olden times - perhaps even a casualty of the Rune Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It is a creature of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste to the world of men and [[yordle]]s. \n\nNo one is quite sure how Brand found his way to [[Valoran]], but he began his predations at once. Overcome by [[Demacia]]n forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of [[the League]] or die.

Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF).

He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good {{w|dogfight}} in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement which he felt 'cut the engines and clipped the wings'. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him.

She guarded their lands with pride as they prospered, but such unity could not last forever. The great tribe fractured into three, and after that upheaval, Anivia watched the people of the Freljord become embroiled in battle. As she strove to calm the turmoil tearing her home apart, Anivia began to sense a greater threat: {{ci|Lissandra|an ancient evil}} growing deep within the earth. To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt. Like blood in water, darkness crept into the Freljord. With her destiny so tied to the power of the land, Anivia knew if such evil took root in her home, that same darkness would find its way into {{csl|Anivia|Blackfrost|her heart}}. She could no longer remain a mere guardian - the cryophoenix had to act.\n\nAnivia soon discovered an ally in {{ci|Ashe}}, the Frost Archer.

Now, with war on the horizon, Anivia prepares to fight for peace, but she knows the inevitable truth of her destiny.

He realized that his only option was to destroy the power source, but Viktor stood in his way.\n\nThough their clash left both scientists heavily wounded, Jayce managed a desperate strike at the crystal. He shattered it and escaped as Viktor's machines erupted in flames.\n\nWhen he returned home, exhausted but victorious, the citizens of Piltover hailed Jayce as a hero. He reveled in the adoration, but knew that his actions had drawn the attention of dangerous enemies.\n\nNow devoted to the defense of his people, Jayce is Piltover's best hope for a bright future.  \n\n", "title": "the Defender of Tomorrow"}, "Blitzcrank": {"key": "Blitzcrank", "id": 53, "name": "Blitzcrank", "background": "Male\n|race = Steam Golem &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Techmaturgical Construct)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Piltover Policeman {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Rammus, Orianna, Viktor\n|rivals = \n|related = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Though {{ci|Blitzcrank}} may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has a heart of gold... encased in a framework of iron... in a carapace of steel.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\n[[Zaun]] is a place where both magic and science have gone awry, and the unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city.

However, he soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\nOver time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity. As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem's creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth. In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.\n\nBacked by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity. A unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in.

Realizing her unique skills, the Demacian military recruited and trained her in covert operations.\n\nShe quickly became renowned for her daring achievements; the most dangerous of which found her deep in the chambers of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] High Command. She extracted valuable inside information about the Noxus-[[Ionia]]n conflict, earning her great favor with Demacians and Ionians alike.\n\nHowever, reconnaissance and surveillance was not for her.

A manic and impulsive criminal, she despises nothing more than boredom, and gleefully unleashes her own volatile brand of pandemonium to the one place she finds dullest: [[Piltover]]. With an arsenal of deadly toys, she unleashes the brightest explosions and loudest blasts - all the better to shock and surprise the hapless authorities. Always just out of the law's reach, Jinx's favorite game is to toy with Piltover's finest - especially {{ci|Vi}}.\n\nPiltover had long been known as the City of Progress, a place where peace and order reigned. That serenity was challenged when a new kind of criminal arrived, the likes of whom had never been seen. This mysterious outlaw unleashed a series of warped and destructive capers that endangered the entire city, and left its people reeling from the worst crime spree in Piltover's history.\n\nAs the string of crimes without rhyme or reason hit the city, sightings of the lawbreaker emerged. Though the young woman's origins were a mystery, some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms, while others described the street fashions of [[Zaun]] in her dress. Because her arrival always brought trouble with it, those who crossed her path soon gave her a name: {{ci|Jinx}}.\n\n[[File:Jinx graffity of Vi.png|right|275px]]\n\nJinx's rampage escalated. {{ci|Caitlyn}} - the sheriff of Piltover - responded by declaring a state of emergency and organizing a city-wide manhunt. In typical Jinx fashion, the criminal marked the Piltover treasury, the city's most secure building, with a direct challenge to its most abrasive officer. With a caricature of Vi's face splashed across the treasury's facade, and with a time and date of her supposed raid, Jinx was openly daring the enforcer to stop her from robbing it.\n\nDetermined to put the troublemaker behind bars, Vi watched and waited outside the treasury until Jinx's time had finally come. True to her scrawled promise, the smiling menace showed her face. Knowing this was her chance to capture the outlaw, Vi gave chase into the building's interior. She smashed through wall after wall to chase down Jinx, who giggled as she lit up the evacuated treasury with fiery explosions. Vi finally cornered the criminal inside the vault, but Jinx wasn't done just yet. With a maniacal laugh, she fired a barrage of rockets, bringing the entire building down upon them both.\n\nWhen Vi finally crawled out of the ruins, the battered enforcer found no trace of Jinx. Adding insult to injury, not a single ounce of gold had been taken from the ruined vault. Instead, the criminal left a parting message to her favorite officer of the law - a challenge only now visible through the gaping opening in Piltover's skyline. The lights of the city spelled out a simple taunt: you'll never catch me. As Vi read the message, she heard the distant laughter of her new nemesis, and the city plunged into utter darkness for the very first time.\n\n", "title": "the Loose Cannon"}, "Kalista": {"key": "Kalista", "id": 429, "name": "Kalista", "background": "* {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|Soul Sentinels}}\n* {{ii|The Black Spear}}\n|render = Kalista Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Female\n|race = Specter &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = Spirit of Vengeance\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|enemies = Cassiopeia, LeBlanc, Lissandra, Hecarim, Zed\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/kalista?_k=cw2on3 Spear of Vengeance]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;When wronged, we seek justice.

Though these creatures had their enemies, the city was an impenetrable fortress, and, in the safety it provided, they grew complacent.\n\nFizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied living so cushioned a life. Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble. In his many adventures he grew to be a powerful fighter with a sharp cleverness that let him skirt danger with ease.\n\nOne day Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted {{ai|Seastone Trident|Fizz}} from the ruins and set out alone. Fizz wandered the ocean in search of his people for years, using the skills he'd learned during his adventures as a young boy to survive.\n\nFinally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life above the water and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz inadvertently meddled in the affairs of the humans who lived there, and his presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many residents who eventually sought to capture or kill him.\n\nFizz found himself cornered, and he prepared to return to the sea despite the fondness he'd come to hold for Bilgewater. As he stood at the docks, {{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|a massive dragon-shark}} attacked the port. Fizz defeated the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of the creature's weaknesses to his advantage.\n\nHaving earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz decided to stay in Bilgewater.

During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual instrument to anxious collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the house.\n\nWhen a wealthy [[Demacia]]n woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument, she immediately embarked to Ionia.

However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer, an accomplishment that [[Noxus]] noticed.

A strong leader torn between tradition and revolution, Karma seeks to protect the peace of Ionia - by force if necessary.\n\nKarma once lived a tranquil life in a small Ionian village. Led by elder monks, the villagers practiced a tradition of benevolent magic and pacifism. Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\n\nHer inner peace was tested when the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded Ionia. While the village's elder monks insisted their peaceful ways would spare them from violence, Karma had heard enough tales of Noxian cruelty to openly question the elders' wisdom. Stern and unmoving, they told her to trust in tradition.\n\nWhen the invaders marched on the village, the elder monks rode out to negotiate a bloodless end to the battle. The Noxian general was offended by their show of weakness and slaughtered the monks himself as he ordered his soldiers to strike the village.\n\nAs the Noxians advanced, the villagers prepared to accept death, bound to their peaceful vows. But Karma would not accept death and instead saw another way: sacrificing a single life to spare many others.\n\nTo save her people, she drew upon {{ai|Mantra|Karma|the power within}} and summoned the full force of her will. {{ai|Soulflare|Karma|A burst of spirit fire}} emerged from her body and spiraled towards the Noxian general.\n\nThe flame took the form of {{ai|Gathering Fire|Karma|twin dragons}}, the symbol of Ionia itself. It was the first time Karma had ever used her powers to harm instead of protect, and neither she nor the villagers had ever seen anything like it.\n\nWhen the magic subsided, the general had fallen before her and his soldiers had scattered. The opposing forces surrendered to Karma's strength leaving her people, and their traditions, untouched.\n\nWhile the war raged on, Karma became a formidable leader of the Ionian resistance, but the conflict did not end when Noxus' armies fled the Ionian shores.\n\nIonia became divided between the resistance fighters who craved vengeance and the monks who demanded a return to spiritual tradition. Karma saw a third path, one that combined the strength Ionia found in war with the peaceful traditions the nation still held dear.\n\nShe now seeks to return her ravaged land to an enduring peace.\n\n", "title": "the Enlightened One"}, "Annie": {"key": "Annie", "id": 1, "name": "Annie", "background": "|render = Annie Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|residence = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* The Grey Order\n|allies = \n|friends = Amumu\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n\nThere have always been those within [[Noxus]] who did not agree with the evils perpetrated by the [[Noxian]] High Command.

These political and social outcasts, known as the Grey Order, sought to leave their neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge.\n\nThe leaders of this outcast society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Grey Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an exodus of magicians and other intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond [[the Great Barrier]] to the northern reaches of the unforgiving [[Voodoo Lands]]. Though survival was a challenge at times, the Grey Order's colony managed to thrive in a land where so many others would have failed.\n\nYears after the exodus, Gregori and Amoline had a child: {{ci|Annie}}.

At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorceled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet. To this day she keeps her bear {{moi|Tibbers}} by her side, often keeping him spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child's toy.

Both a warrior and a mystic, Volibear seeks to defend the ancient ways and the warrior spirit of his tribe.\n\nThough history recorded their once legendary feats in battle, the Ursine now lived in tranquil seclusion. The warriors were headed by a triumvirate of leaders who maintained a long-lived isolation, avoiding the petty affairs and conflicts of others. As shaman to the three, Volibear was a respected sage known for his insight. It was an era of unprecedented peace, but Volibear felt dread stirring within him. Prosperity was turning the tribe soft and weak, and many had long forgotten the sacred art of war. In time, Volibear felt the fire of their souls would be extinguished. When he revealed his misgivings to the triumvirate, they refused to listen and warned him to know his place.\n\nSeeking wisdom, Volibear undertook a perilous climb to the peak of the Ursine's sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. The eye of the storm was said to bestow portents, and legend held that the tempest would mark the next great chieftain of the tribe. As Volibear ascended the peak, he was struck by an unnatural bolt of lightning. When the shaman awoke, he was possessed by a horrific vision of the Freljord utterly consumed by darkness. Volibear saw an unprepared and complacent Ursine force slaughtered by [[Watcher|terrible creatures of ice]]. In an instant, he knew his race would perish if they did not prepare for war.\n\nVolibear rushed down the mountainside to recount what he had seen, but found the path blocked by three Ursine - the triumvirate. Knowing he would end the lasting peace, they refused to heed Volibear's warning and demanded his silence, by his word - or his death. Resolute and adamant, Volibear swore that the Ursine's very survival depended on his message, and launched into ferocious combat against the three. A terrible clash ensued, and just as Volibear succumbed to his opponents, he {{ai|Thunder Claws|Volibear|called upon}} the power of the maelstrom. Unleashing raw lightning, he struck the trio down with a thunderous blow. Stunned and astonished, the triumvirate beheld the sign of Ursine leadership: the force of the sacred storm.\n\nRecognizing his foretold ascendance, the triumvirate appointed Volibear as the Ursine's new leader. His influence was swift and decisive: he roused his tribe from complacency, revived their battle-hardened traditions, and allied with {{ci|Sejuani}}, the warrior who would fight with them against {{ci|Lissandra|the coming evil}}.

Along its perimeter, he mounted the skulls of his slain prey - a warning to would-be aggressors.\n\nHe thought undisputed reign of a region would fulfill him, but instead, he grew restless.

Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a monster could be contained.

This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover.\n\nBorn the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, as she was single-handedly defeating crime in Piltover and had developed into a ravishing beauty as well. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by [[Demacia]] to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.\n\nThe bandit, who always left a card with an ornate {{sbc|'C'}} at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across [[Valoran]].

Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops in a devastating campaign against Demacia.\n\nAfter proving his power on the battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation's strength. Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to reshape the Noxian leadership. He identified weak figureheads and violently removed them from their positions of power.\n\nMany in Noxus saw Darius' cull as an attempt to seize power, but he had a different plan for the throne.

He liked to tinker, preferring the company of gadgets, and he could usually be found rummaging through the junkyard. \n\nHe showed great potential as a mechanic.

Now forbidden, instilling golems with reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more expert of craftsmen. One such visionary was the [[Demacia]]n artificer, Durand.\n\nPeerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand's constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their [[Noxus|Noxian]] neighbors. For his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum opus: Galio.\n\nThis mighty construct forged in the image of a gargoyle kept him safe on his journeys, allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those hostile to his homeland. That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\n\nAs Durand crossed the [[Howling Marsh]] with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in force. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists.\n\nStripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired. For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame. Then, on one nondescript day, a sad but determined {{ci|Poppy|yordle girl}} carrying a mighty [[Demacia]]n crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest.\n\nHidden in plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn [[yordle]]. She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia.\n\nThis encounter lit a spark in Galio's eye. Remembering the cause that his master had died defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake of this brave creature.

Thousands of great heroes have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its preeminent rival, [[Noxus]].

The infantrymen who beheld this event (and survived) commented that it seemed as though the two were locked in a mortal waltz set against a symphony of clashing blades.\n\nGaren, the pride of the Demacian military and the leader of the Dauntless Vanguard, returned from this battle breathless for the first time in his career, though some speculate this was due to reasons other than exhaustion. The plausibility of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again.

As the last living practitioner of Wuju, Master Yi has devoted his life to finding able pupils to carry on the legacy of his lost people.\n\nEven before Yi mastered Wuju, he was considered one of the most skilled practitioners of the mystical martial art. He would soon prove his mastery when word of a massive [[Noxus|Noxian]] invasion reached his remote village. Yi swept across the battlefields of [[Ionia]], turning back the tide of Noxus' vast infantry with {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|swift}} and {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|deadly}} strikes, much to the embarrassment of the Noxian High Command.\n\nRecognizing the threat the Wuju disciples posed to their invasion, the Noxians chose to unleash a nightmarish {{ci|Singed|chemical attack}} on the home of the deadly art. Those who somehow survived the poisonous concoction had their minds twisted beyond repair. Yi's home was left in ruin.\n\nAt the war's conclusion, Yi returned to the grotesque remains of his village. There he became the attack's final casualty. Slain in spirit, if not in body, Yi clung to the only feeling left within his heart: vengeance. Driven only by his desire to punish those who'd destroyed his home, Yi spent years training in seclusion.\n\nHe became a deadlier swordsman than he had ever been, but true mastery of Wuju still eluded him. At the height of Yi's frustration, {{ci|Wukong|a monkey}} of unusually noble bearing interrupted his training.\n\nStanding as straight and tall as a man, the monkey watched and mimicked Yi's movements. Yi shooed the monkey away, but the agile creature took great amusement in turning Yi's own techniques against him.\n\nGradually, Yi felt his anger subside as he sparred with the playful animal, and when the burden of his hatred had fully lifted, he found he had caught the monkey by his tail. Yi then understood that he would never master Wuju so long as he pursued it for vengeance, and as he let go of the monkey, he also released his desire to shed his enemy's blood.\n\nYi thanked the monkey for showing him what he'd been blind to, and was surprised when the creature actually replied. He wished to learn Yi's art of fighting.\n\nIt was an odd request, but through it Yi saw his new path: the way to honor the memory of his lost people was to pass their teachings on to a new generation.\n\n", "title": "the Wuju Bladesman"}, "Elise": {"key": "Elise", "id": 60, "name": "Elise", "background": "|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|render = Elise Render.png\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Shapeshifter)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Immortal Bastion, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* House Zaavan Mistress\n* Artifact Collector\n* {{moi|Vilemaw}}'s High Priestess and Feeder &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36346739#36346739 kitae on Vilemaw]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] [[The Black Rose]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Vilemaw\n|friends = LeBlanc, Vladimir\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/elise?_k=h7d851 Spider Queen]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Beauty is power too, and can strike swifter than any sword.&quot;'' - {{ci|Elise}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nElise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep in the Immortal Bastion of [[Noxus]].

Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment of Noxus's wealthy leaders.\n\nAlistar's once noble soul slowly became twisted, and he would have been driven to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and eventually arranged for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]] to fight as a [[champion]], hoping to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially unwilling to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since discovered that there is power in fame, and he has become a vocal advocate for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden\u2014something that has made him very unpopular with Noxus's nobles.

As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general, many paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade.\n\nRigorously trained by the finest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking [[Demacia]]n officer.\n\nAs she set to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night.\n\nKatarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nFurious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task.

He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\n\nThe earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Protectorate and the [[File:ProfileIcon713 Red Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Magelords. Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped. They braced for inevitable defeat.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words, he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. His presence inspired the desperate warriors. At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies, his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon, the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.\n\n[[File:Aatrox Statuesketch.png|left|180px]]\n\nAatrox vanished after that battle, but the Protectorate army's newfound fury did not. Their surprising triumph led to many more until they were able to finally return home victorious. Their countrymen hailed them as heroes, but though they had saved their entire civilization from destruction, darkness lingered in the mind of each warrior. Something within them had changed. Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.\n\nTales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\n\n", "title": "the Darkin Blade"}, "Draven": {"key": "Draven", "id": 119, "name": "Draven", "background": "|render = Draven Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Executioner\n* &lt;small&gt;(News Reporter {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = Draven\n|friends = Darius, Draven\n|rivals = Darius\n|related = \n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The 'best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.&quot;'' - {{ci|Draven}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nUnlike his brother {{ci|Darius}}, victory in battle was never enough for Draven.

They never succeeded. Rejecting the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright outfits and developed {{ai|Whirling Death|Draven|flashy signature moves}} to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. \n\nAs his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center of attention.

Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.\n\nWhat exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in [[Summoner's Rift]]. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door.

What few who followed and survived were {{ai|Terrify|Fiddlesticks|driven mad by fear}}, mere husks of men gibbering about {{ai|Crowstorm|Fiddlesticks|crows}} and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy. Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the [[Fields of Justice]], what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown. His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand before him.\n\n", "title": "the Harbinger of Doom"}, "Pantheon": {"key": "Pantheon", "id": 80, "name": "Pantheon", "background": "Male\n|race         = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = &lt;s&gt;Rakkor Tribe&lt;/s&gt;, [[Mount Targon]] &lt;small&gt;(Ancient times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * &lt;s&gt;Rakkor Warrior&lt;/s&gt;\n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(War)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(A Baker{{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Mount_Targon_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;[[Mount Targon|The Rakkor]]&lt;/s&gt;\n|allies       = Aurelion Sol\n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Leona\n|enemies      = \n|related      = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/pantheon.html Artisan of War]\n}}\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Bring forth one true champion, or a hundred more like you, and then we shall have a battle that will be spoken of until the end of time.&quot;'' - {{ci|Pantheon}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe peerless warrior known as Pantheon is a nigh-unstoppable paragon of battle.

[[Noxus|Noxian]] Legions ripped through the land like a serrated knife, their gleaming armor blood-red in the sinking sun. Blazing temples lit the waning daylight, and distant cries of anguish filled the air.\n\nNestled in the foothills of Tevasa Mountain was a village of perhaps a hundred people - but home to no great warriors. Some families fled. Some prayed. Others held their loved ones close and wept. Fifty brave souls prepared to fight. They cleaned the dirt from their pitchforks and bound knives to broom handles.\n\nMounting panic shone in the eyes of every defender; they knew they had no hope. With the dust of the Noxian advance already visible in the distance, there was little to do but make peace with their gods. The sons and daughters of Ionia took deep, steadying breaths of mountain air, gazed into the starry twilight, and waited for the slaughter soon to come.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\n{{ci|Ahri}}'s nine tails swished: a nervous tic. Her sharpened senses warned of danger. Crouched in the shadow of a towering willow she listened, watched, and waited. She had observed the villagers for weeks: watching from afar, but never trusting herself to approach. She heard families talking over dinner, the laughs of women who might have been her sisters, and the games of children. Ahri would listen for hours on end, tearing herself away only when the longing grew too sharp.\n\nThough she had little understanding of nations or politics, instinct alone told her something was very wrong in the world today. Curious, and fearing for the villagers, Ahri sniffed the air. She pinpointed the source of her disquiet, and dashed into the night.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\nSeven Noxian scouts eased through the brush, pushing ever closer to the mountain. Dark-eyed and wary, the men kept their hands on their weapons as they crept through the settling dusk.\n\nAhri found them in a matter of moments and followed them through the forest. She darted between the trees, suspicion mounting as she observed their movements. Of their mission Ahri could only guess, but she had fought enough battles to know killers when she saw them.\n\nThe squad's captain scanned the undergrowth. Without breaking stride he whispered a brief order to the man at his back, who relayed it to the man at his. Ahri thought nothing of it, and continued her silent pursuit.\n\nSuddenly, seven hands reached for seven arrows.\n\n''&quot;Now!&quot;'' roared the captain. The Noxians loosed as one, and a flurry of hawk-fletched arrows flashed towards Ahri.\n\nShe dived from the bushes as two arrows sliced through her sleeve. Ahri ripped it off and dashed into cover, yellow eyes aflame with shock and fury. She would lose no sleep in killing these men.\n\nAhri opened her palms to the sky, and felt the raw power of her spirit coalesce. Her nine tails fanned out in all directions as she pulled white fire from the air with a snarl. With a flick of her wrist, Ahri summoned {{ai|Fox-Fire|Ahri|three motes of spinning flame}}. She dodged another volley of arrows before leaping for the nearest tree, coiling her tails to spring from its trunk, back towards her assailants. The Noxians scattered as she landed in their midst. The man closest to her thrust a knife, but the blade cut only air. Ahri danced through her foes with {{ai|Spirit Rush|Ahri|blinding speed}}.\n\nThe fiery motes around her engulfed the three nearest men. White flames seared them, but Ahri had more than brute force in her arsenal. She vaulted from tree to tree, rising higher with every bound. She spotted the squad's captain crouched between a tangle of tree roots, his bowstring taut. Given half a chance, Ahri knew he'd put an arrow through her eye. She crept silently to the branches above the captain's shelter and spoke, her soft words laced with beguiling power.\n\n''&quot;Human&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Come to me.&quot;''\n\nThe captain's features went slack. Through no will of his own, he set down his bow and walked from cover. He looked up, eyes wide with desperation and desire.\n\n''&quot;Now climb&quot;'', said Ahri, blowing the man a {{ai|Charm|Ahri|kiss}}.\n\nThe captain, utterly in her thrall, scrambled for footholds on the tree trunk. Ahri summoned {{ai|Orb of Deception|Ahri|a sphere of lambent energy}} to her palm, its innocent appearance belying its vast power. She drew back her arm, allowed herself a vulpine grin, and hurled it downwards.\n\nThe orb streaked through the captain before flying back to Ahri palm, and his smoking body fell to the forest floor with a thud. The remaining scouts fled in terror, but running proved every bit as futile as hiding. Ahri vaulted from branch to branch, tails whirling behind her as she struck two men down with thunderous bolts of energy.\n\nThe last man collapsed in a tangle of limbs, clutching at his broken bones as Ahri landed gracefully beside him. She grabbed the Noxian's throat, and put her face an inch from his.\n\n''&quot;You brought this on yourselves&quot;'', she hissed, and snapped the man's neck with a blast of concussive force.\n\nOnly one task remained.\n\nAhri had no qualms about gaining her humanity by taking it from men who had no use for it. She knelt over the fallen Noxian, feeling his pulse fade. She placed her hands to either side of his face. The light of his {{ai|Essence Theft|Ahri|essence}} flowed from his eyes and mouth, and a thrilling sensation surged through Ahri. His humanity poured into her, and she felt the fox within withdraw with every heartbeat. Her tails curled in pleasure, her expression rapturous.\n\nYet even lost in that glorious sensation, Ahri heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The villagers, hearing the sounds of combat, were coming to investigate. She couldn't let them see her like this, draining what remained of a dying man's life. To their eyes she would seem a terrifying mystery: a damnable half-breed stray, neither human nor beast.\n\nReluctantly, Ahri turned from her feast, seeing shapes moving through the trees and bushes. She recognized the men and women she had watched from afar, remembering the friendship she hoped they might one day share.\n\nBut today was not that day, and Ahri turned to flee into the woods.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 2.png|center|650px]]\n\n", "title": "the Nine-Tailed Fox"}, "Malzahar": {"key": "Malzahar", "id": 90, "name": "Malzahar", "background": "|render = Malzahar Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Shurima]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Icathia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Void Prophet\n* &lt;s&gt;Seer&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n* The Cult of the Void\n|allies = \n|friends = Kog'Maw\n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = \n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The land may melt, the sea may swell, the sky may fall... but they will come!&quot;'' - {{ci|Malzahar}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nMany men have gone mad beneath the glare of the [[Shurima]]n sun, but it was during the night's chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity.

His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of [[Runeterra]]'s greatest boons, but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind.\n\nIn his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned. For some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding, but with each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\n\nHe ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm. His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as [[Icathia]]. Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained. When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.\n\nBeyond it lain the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods. His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of [[the Void]]. His once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of [[Valoran]] beset by creatures of the Void.\n\nStanding alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees: [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]].

Of the twelve soldiers who had departed with him, only two returned.\n\nIn a tone as cold and steady as steel, he swore to bring the enemies of Demacia to their knees.\n\n", "title": "the Exemplar of Demacia"}, "Nami": {"key": "Nami", "id": 267, "name": "Nami", "background": "* {{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|Sharks}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|(Koi Fish}} {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ci|Urf|(Urf}} {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Nami Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = [[Guardian's Sea#Race|Marai]]\n|birthplace = [[Guardian's Sea]]\n|residence = \n|occupation = Tidecaller\n|faction = \n* [[Guardian's Sea]]\n* The Marai\n|allies = \n|friends = Fizz\n|rivals = Nautilus\n|related = \n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;I am the tide, and I cannot be turned.&quot;'' - {{ci|Nami}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nNami channels the primal energies of the ocean, harnessing its mystical {{ai|Ebb and Flow|Nami|restorative properties}} and commanding the raw power of {{ai|Tidal Wave|Nami|the tides}} themselves. Though many doubted her, Nami had the bravery and determination to take on a dangerous quest when no one else would. Now her people believe she is the {{ai|Tidecaller's Blessing|Nami|Tidecaller}}, a chosen one destined to complete a quest essential to the survival of her entire race.\n\nThe Tidecaller's sacred duty is to acquire a moonstone, a powerful object found only in the towering reaches of the surface world. Her people, the Marai, rely on the moonstone's light to ward off the terrors of the depths. However, the stone's power lasts only one hundred years. Before its light fades, the Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and carry it to the surface. There, on the night of the winter solstice of the hundredth year, the Tidecaller makes a ceremonial exchange with a landwalker bearing a moonstone. By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.\n\nHowever, in Nami's time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller had been found. Without a chosen one to complete the quest, her people would face disaster, but the Marai waited in faith that the Tidecaller would appear. Nami refused to sit idle, insisting that without a Tidecaller to save them, someone had to act. Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured alone into the dangerous depths where she had defeated the Kraken and survived an incident of being eaten by the Megalodon. None expected her to survive, but after six days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand. The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.\n\nWhen Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore. She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive. Nami faced a choice. She knew the surface world only through tale and rumor, but the survival of the Marai depended upon her. Summoning the tide to {{ai|Surging Tides|Nami|bear her ashore}}, Nami began her search for the moonstone and became the first of her kind to explore the world above the ocean. She left her home behind, and vowed not to return until she had completed the Tidecaller's quest. She was then gifted extraordinary power and could control waters at her own leisure and began her journey into a new world.  \n\n", "title": "the Tidecaller"}, "Jhin": {"key": "Jhin", "id": 202, "name": "Jhin", "background": "* {{ai|Dancing Grenade|Jhin}}\n* {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|Lotus Trap}}\n|render =  Jhin Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Artist\n* Assassin\n* Serial Killer\n* &lt;s&gt;Theatrical Stagehand&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Sona, Master Yi\n|enemies = Shen, Zed\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-BgDEy2AE Mind of the Virtuoso]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-bio-jhin-virtuoso Virtuoso]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Art requires a certain... cruelty.&quot;'' - {{ci|Jhin}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nI=\nJhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.\n\nFor years, Ionia's southern mountains were plagued by the infamous &quot;Golden Demon&quot;. Throughout the province of Zhyun, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roads - but nothing slowed the beast's grisly work.\n\nIn desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho for help. Upon hearing of the region's plight, Kusho feigned an excuse for why he couldn't help. But a week later the master, his son {{ci|Shen}}, and star apprentice {{ci|Zed}} disguised themselves as merchants and moved to the province. In secret, they visited the countless families emotionally shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for possible connections or patterns to the murders.\n\nTheir investigation took four long years, and left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho's temple, began to struggle with his studies. Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: ''&quot;Good and evil are not truths. They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.&quot;''\n\nDepicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the capture of the &quot;Golden Demon&quot; would be the seventh and final great feat in the illustrious career of Lord Kusho. On the eve of the Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Everyone had assumed only an evil spirit could commit these horrifying crimes, but Kusho had realized the killer was an ordinary man. The famed &quot;Golden Demon&quot; was actually a mere stagehand in Zhyun's traveling theaters and opera houses working under the name {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}}.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 1.png|center]]\n\nWhen they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. Despite the horrors of Jhin's actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and left at Tuula Prison. Shen disagreed, but accepted the emotionless logic of his father's judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.\n\nThough imprisoned in Tuula for many years, the polite and shy Khada Jhin revealed little of himself - even his real name remained a mystery. But while a prisoner, the monks noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, the guards and monks could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 3.png|center]]\n\nOutside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire's invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation's appetite for bloodshed. The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror.\n\nNow with access to the Kashuri armories' new weapons, and nearly unlimited funds, the scale of Khada Jhin's &quot;performances&quot; has grown. His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia's secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 2.png|center]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|II=\n{{ai|Whisper|Jhin|The gun in his hand}} was simply a tool - but a perfectly crafted one. Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: This detail spoke of its creator's pride and confidence. It was not a Piltovian weapon - those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.\n\nHe wiped the gun's stock a fourth time. He couldn't be sure it was clean until he wiped it down four times. Didn't matter that he hadn't used it. Didn't matter that he was only going to stow it in the bag under the bed. He couldn't put it away until he was sure it was clean. And he couldn't be sure it was clean until he had wiped it down four times. It was getting clean though. Four times makes it clean.\n\nIt was clean, and it was wonderful. His new patrons had been generous. But did the finest painters not deserve the finest brushes?\n\nThe scale and precision of the new device made his previous work with blades seem insignificant by comparison. Understanding firearm mechanics had taken him weeks of study, but evolving his chi techniques from blades had taken months.\n\nThe gun held four shots. Each bullet had been infused with magical energy. Each bullet was as perfect as a Lassilan monk's blade. Each bullet was the paint from which his art would flow. Each bullet was a masterpiece. It didn't just cut apart the body. It rearranged it.\n\nThe rehearsal at the mill town had already shown the gun's potential. And his new employers had been pleased with the work's reception.\n\nHe had finished polishing it, but with the gun in his right hand, the temptation was too great. He knew he shouldn't, but he unpacked the black, eel-skin bodysuit. He drew the fingertips of his left hand across the slick surface of the clothes. The feel of the skin's oily surface quickened his breath. He picked up the tight, leather mask, then - unable to help himself - slid it over his face. It covered his right eye and mouth. It constricted his breathing and removed his depth perception...\n\nDelightful.\n\nHe was putting on the shoulder armor when the bells he'd hidden on the steps leading up to his room sounded. He quickly folded up the weapon and removed the mask.\n\n''&quot;Hello?&quot;'' the maid asked through the door. The lilt in her voice hinted to an upbringing far south of this town.\n\n''&quot;You did what I asked?&quot;'' he said.\n\n''&quot;Yes, sir. A white lantern every four yards. A red lantern every sixteen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I can begin&quot;'', {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}} said as he swung open the door to his room.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened as he exited his room. Jhin was well aware of how he looked. Normally, it elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing, but today was a performance day.\n\nToday, Khada Jhin cut a slender, elegant figure as he walked out with {{ai|Deadly Flourish|Jhin|a cane}}. He was hunched, and his cloak seemed to cover some huge deformity on his shoulder, but a jaunty stride belied this. He forcefully tapped the cane ahead of him as he marched toward the window. He tapped the frame rhythmically - three beats, then a fourth. His gold sparkled, his cream cloak flowed, and his jewels glittered in the sun.\n\n''&quot;What... what is that?&quot;'' the maid asked, indicating Jhin's shoulder.\n\nJhin paused for a moment to study the woman's cherubic face. It was round and perfectly symmetrical. A dull and predictable design. Removed, it would make a terrible mask.\n\n''&quot;It's for {{ai|Curtain Call|Jhin|the crescendo}}, my darling&quot;'', Khada Jhin said.\n\nFrom the inn's window, he had a clear view of the rest of the town in the valley below him. This performance had to be wonderful, but there was still so much work to do. The councilman would be returning this evening - and so far, all of Jhin's plans for tonight seemed... uninspired.\n\n''&quot;I brought some flowers for your room&quot;'', the woman said, walking past him.\n\nHe could have used someone else to place the lanterns. But he didn't. He could have changed clothes before opening his door. But he didn't. Now she had seen Khada Jhin in his finery.\n\nThe inspiration he needed was so obvious now. So preordained. There was never a choice. There was no escaping the Art.\n\nHe would have to make this maid's face... more interesting.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|III=\nThe candied pork glistened on top of the five-flavor broth. The aroma entranced {{ci|Shen}}, but he set aside his spoon. As the waitress left, she smiled and nodded in approval. The fat had yet to melt into the broth. Doubtless, the soup was already excellent, but in a moment, the flavor would be at its peak. Patience.\n\nShen considered the interior of the White Cliffs Inn. It was deceptively simple and rough. The wood weavers had been masters, removing the tree bark and living leaves only where necessary.\n\nThe candle on Shen's table flickered... wrongly. He slid away from the table, retrieving his blades from under his cloak.\n\n''&quot;Your students are as quiet as a pregnant worax&quot;'', Shen said.\n\nAlone and dressed like a merchant, {{ci|Zed}} entered the inn. Brushing past the waitress, he sat down three tables from Shen. Every part of him wanted to {{ai|Shadow Dash|Shen|dash at his foe}}. To avenge his father. But such was not the way of twilight. He calmed himself as he realized the distance was too far... but only by the length of Shen's index finger.\n\nShen looked over at Zed, expecting to see him grin. Instead, his rival sighed. His skin was sallow, and dark folds hung beneath his eyes.\n\n''&quot;Five years, I have waited&quot;'', Shen said.\n\n''&quot;Have I misjudged the distance?&quot;'' Zed asked wearily.\n\n''&quot;Even if my head is cut off, I will still close and strike&quot;'', Shen said, sliding his foot backward and cocking it against the floor. Zed was ten paces and one half of a finger length away.\n\n''&quot;Your path's closer to mine. Your father's ideals were a weakness. Ionia could no longer afford them&quot;'', Zed said. He leaned back in his chair, keeping himself just outside of the range Shen would need to strike a killing blow. ''&quot;I know that's not something I can make you understand. But I will offer you a chance for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not act because of vengeance. You defy the balance. For that, you are damned&quot;'', Shen said as he inched forward to the edge of his chair.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Jhin|The Golden Demon}} escaped&quot;'', Zed replied.\n\n''&quot;Impossible.&quot;'' But Shen felt a hollowness had caught in his chest.\n\n''&quot;Your father's greatest victory. And now, again, his foolish mercy has tarnished his legacy.&quot;'' Zed shook his head. ''&quot;You know what that... thing is capable of.&quot;'' Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. ''&quot;And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him.&quot;''\n\nShen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.\n\nNow, that monster had returned.\n\nShen put his swords on the table. He looked down at the perfect bowl of soup in front of him. Little droplets of the pork fat's oil shimmered on its surface, but he wasn't hungry anymore.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|IV=\nThere was still no sign of {{ci|Zed}}. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. {{ci|Jhin}} needed to be careful.\n\nFrom the jetty, Jhin looked back to the foreign ship. The tide had come in, and the ship would be leaving in a few moments. He would have to return soon if he was going to perform in Zaun next month. Risk on top of risk.\n\nHe stopped to check his reflection in a puddle. From the water, a worried, elderly merchant stared back at him. Years of acting practice combined with his martial training had given him total control of his facial muscles. It was a common face, and he had given it an unexceptional expression. When he walked up the hill, Jhin blended easily into the crowd.\n\nHe checked the white lanterns above him, counting the distance. If Zed appeared, he would need them. At the inn on the top of the hill, he glanced at the planters where he had hidden {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|traps}}. Sharpened steel blades, shaped like flowers. They protected his escape route in case anything went wrong.\n\nHe thought of how the metal would slice through the crowd and splash the building's freshly painted teal walls with red. It was tempting.\n\nHe was pushing through the crowd when he heard the village elder speaking to {{ci|Shen}}.\n\n''&quot;Why would the demon attack her and the councilmen?&quot;'' the elder asked.\n\nShen, dressed in his blue outfit, didn't answer.\n\nAnother kinkou, a young woman named {{ci|Akali}}, stood beside Shen. She walked to the doorway of the inn.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', Shen said as he blocked her path.\n\n''&quot;What makes you think I'm not ready?&quot;'' Akali asked, annoyed.\n\n''&quot;Because I wasn't when I was your age.&quot;''\n\nAt that moment, a town guard stumbled from the entrance, his face pale and hollow.\n\n''&quot;Her flesh, it was... it was...&quot;'' he said. He took a few steps, then collapsed to the ground in shock.\n\n''&quot;He saw it. He saw the flower!&quot;'' Against the far wall, the tavern's owner laughed. Then he began weeping - his face painted by madness.\n\nThese were not people who would forget seeing Khada Jhin's work.\n\nShen scanned the faces of the onlookers.\n\n''Clever boy'', Jhin thought, before fading into the back of the crowd.\n\nHe checked the rooftops for Zed as he walked back to the ship.\n\nThe work was inescapable. Together or apart, Zed and Shen would chase the clues he had left. They would follow them back to the Blossom Festival. Back to Jyom Pass. And when they became desperate, then they would have to work together again.\n\nIt would be like it had been when they were young. They would huddle together in awe and fear.\n\nOnly then would the great Khada Jhin reveal himself...\n\nAnd his true masterpiece would begin.\n\n", "title": "the Virtuoso"}, "Soraka": {"key": "Soraka", "id": 16, "name": "Soraka", "background": "Female\n|race         = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Fallen)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Ionia|Astral Grove]]\n|residence    = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Traveling Healer\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Warwick, Karthus\n|related      =\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Starchild"}, "Veigar": {"key": "Veigar", "id": 45, "name": "Veigar", "background": "Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Warlock\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Lulu\n|rivals       = Teemo\n|related      = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Tiny Master of Evil"}, "Janna": {"key": "Janna", "id": 40, "name": "Janna", "background": "* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1386.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Janna#Zephyr|Zyphyr]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n|render = Janna Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Piltover]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Weather Mage\n* Magical Regulator\n* &lt;small&gt;(Weather Reporter {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* Independent\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Do not be captivated by {{ci|Janna}}'s beauty.

Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren't enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of {{ai|Zephyr|Janna|air}}. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she was born of it.

She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state of [[Piltover]] and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there. Janna is also a new favorite of the League's many fans. She is often the center of attention at functions, fan appreciation days, and other celebratory events.

What had once been heavy slabs of muscle in years gone by had slowly given way to fat, but he was still a big, intimidating man. His gaze was inscrutable, his eyes having long been replaced with soulless, reflective black lenses.\n\nA pair of heavily augmented bodyguards stood to either side of him. They were the best money could buy, their bodies having been turned into brutal chem-tech weapons by the brilliant, albeit deranged, scientist {{ci|Singed}}.\n\nTakeda's inherent violence and ambition had seen him rise from humble beginnings to become one of [[Zaun]]'s most powerful chem-barons, the infamous rulers of the undercity. Today he planned the downfall of yet another of his rivals.\n\n''&quot;Bring her in, Ortos&quot;'', he said, through a cloud of exhaled smoke.\n\nUnseen chains rattled and pulled taut, and the dark iron doors to his office ground open. Two more bodyguards stood to mute attention outside. One could never be too careful. Takeda had learned that the hard way, as his many scars attested.\n\nTakeda's shaven-headed chamberlain, Ortos, stepped forward, leading a petite figure to the entrance.\n\nShadows clung to her, making it difficult to see her clearly, though Takeda glimpsed a flash of blue-tinged flesh and a pair of {{ai|Agony's Embrace|Evelynn|predator's eyes}} that reflected the chem-fire sconces of his office. He felt an unfamiliar tremor of apprehension at her appearance, but forced it aside. He was one of the most feared men in Zaun. Why should he feel uneasy in his own office?\n\n''&quot;The Lady {{ci|Evelynn}}&quot;'', Ortos announced.\n\nTakeda waved a gloved hand, and Ortos retreated, the doors grinding shut behind him. Evelynn sauntered forward, moving with sublime grace, the heels of her boots echoing sharply.\n\nShe came to a halt on the other side of Takeda's wide desk, and planted her hands on her hips. He could see her more clearly as the shadows retreated to the corners of the room.\n\nHer slender figure was clad in gleaming red leather, and her eyes were yellow and almond-shaped, like those of a cat. A wild mane of crimson hair framed her face, and sharp canines glinted as her lips parted in a sardonic smile.\n\n''&quot;I've been called many things&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;but a lady? That's a new one.&quot;''\n\nTakeda leaned back in his seat, considering her. ''&quot;Around here, most call you the Widowmaker.&quot;''\n\nEvelynn shrugged. ''&quot;At least it's accurate.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I've never married, myself&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;But the one I want you to kill, the Baron Artega Holt, has a wife. Two of them, actually, and a throng of mistresses.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He sounds perfectly charming. I'm sure they'll miss him dearly&quot;'', purred Evelynn.

''&quot;Has it been so long since I stepped foot in Zaun that I really need to audition?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We hear something of your exploits from time to time. That [[Demacia]]n knight-commander assassinated last year; that was you, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn gave a slow nod.

''&quot;That was the Gray Lady.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Ah&quot;'', mused Takeda. ''&quot;Interesting. Well, I guess it proves that reputations and gossip can never truly be relied upon. I'll trust what I see with my own eyes.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I'm afraid this might leave you disappointed&quot;'', hissed Evelynn.\n\nThe blue-skinned assassin took a step back and instantly {{ai|Shadow Walk|Evelynn|disappeared into shadow}}. Takeda's bodyguards tensed, flexing their piston-strengthened limbs in unease. Takeda glanced left and right, trying to discern her location. Nothing. She was simply gone, vanished completely, as if she had been swallowed by the darkness.\n\n''&quot;Not bad&quot;'', he said. He'd heard of her power, of course, but such things are often over-exaggerated. He was pleased to see that in this case, the rumors were true.\n\n{{ai|Ravage|Evelynn|Taloned hands}} grabbed him from behind, blood red nails digging into his flesh as Evelynn emerged from the shadows. She was far stronger than she looked, and forcibly turned his head to expose his thick neck. Her grasp was ice-cold, as if warm blood no longer flowed in her veins, and her fangs were inches from his jugular.\n\nHis guards turned instantly, stepping forward to defend their master, but Takeda raised a hand, stopping them in their tracks. He knew they would have been too slow had she truly wished to end his life.\n\n''&quot;What do you think?&quot;'' breathed Evelynn through bared teeth, her chilled breath caressing his throat. ''&quot;Impressed yet?&quot;''\n\nTakeda snorted.\n\n''&quot;Not bad at all&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;Yes, you will do nicely. Now, let us discuss my offer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I hope you can afford me&quot;'', she hissed, tightening her grip, and leaning closer. ''&quot;I don't want you to have wasted my time here.&quot;''\n\nTakeda swallowed uncomfortably. ''&quot;I don't think that will be an issue&quot;'', he said.\n\nEvelynn released him with a shove, and sat on the edge of his table. She stretched like a cat, completely at ease.\n\n''&quot;You haven't yet asked my price&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Whatever it is, I can pay it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Money holds no interest to me, Saito&quot;'', she said.\n\nTakeda furrowed his brow. ''&quot;Then what is it you want?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Much more than you will be willing to give, I'm thinking&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;But I believe you'll come around.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is not the way things work here&quot;'', growled Takeda. ''&quot;I own this district. No one makes demands of me.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You've seen only a fraction of what I can do&quot;'', said Evelynn. She leaned back, smiling. ''&quot;I'm in the perfect position to make a few demands.&quot;''\n\nTakeda said nothing. His body was tense. He opened his mouth to speak but Evelynn interrupted him, holding up a finger.\n\n''&quot;Don't say anything rash, my dear&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;You'd be dead before the words left your lips.&quot;''\n\nTakeda stared at her, frozen in indecision.\n\n''&quot;Very wise&quot;'', Evelynn said, after giving it a moment. She stood, moved back around the desk, and strode toward the door.\n\n''&quot;Artega Holt will be dead before sunup&quot;'', she said, without looking back. ''&quot;I'll be in touch about my first payment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'''First''' payment?&quot;'' said Takeda.\n\n''&quot;The first of many&quot;'', she said, pausing to look back at him. ''&quot;You'd be wise to remember that I can strike wherever there is darkness. And Zaun is such a dark place.&quot;''\n\nShe nodded toward the door, raising an eyebrow. Takeda growled an order, and the doors swung open. Before she left, Evelynn gave him a wink.\n\n''&quot;Don't take it too hard&quot;'', she said, as she melded into the darkness. ''&quot;So long as you don't irritate me, this partnership will work out well for us both.&quot;''\n\nTakeda sat alone in silence. After a few minutes, his chamberlain peered into the room.\n\n''&quot;Can I get you anything, my lord?&quot;'' Ortos said.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Saito Takeda through gritted teeth. He slammed a fist onto his desk. ''&quot;Leave me. All of you, leave me. And stoke the furnace.

His unquenchable thirst for stronger ale has led him in search of the most potent and unconventional ingredients to toss in his still. Impulsive and unpredictable, this rowdy carouser loves cracking kegs as much as cracking heads. Thanks to his strange brews and {{ai|Drunken Rage|Gragas|temperamental nature}}, drinking with Gragas is always a risky proposition.\n\nGragas has an eternal love of good drink, but his massive constitution prevented him from reaching a divine state of intoxication. One night, when he had drained all the kegs and was left wanting, Gragas was struck by a thought rather than the usual barstool: why couldn't he brew himself something that would finally get him truly drunk? It was then that he vowed to create the ultimate ale.\n\nGragas' quest eventually brought him to the [[Freljord]], where the promise of acquiring the purest arctic water for his recipe led him into uncharted glacial wastes. While lost in an unyielding blizzard, Gragas stumbled upon a great [[howling abyss]]. There he found it: a flawless shard of ice unlike anything he had ever seen. Not only did this unmelting shard imbue his lager with incredible properties, but it also had a handy side effect - it kept the mixture chilled at the perfect serving temperature.\n\nUnder the spell of his new concoction, Gragas headed for civilization, eager to share the fermented fruits of his labor. As fate would have it, the first gathering to catch Gragas' bleary eyes would shape the future of the Freljord. He blundered into a deteriorating negotiation between two tribes discussing an alliance with {{ci|Ashe}}. Though Ashe welcomed a break in the tension, the other warriors bristled at the intrusion and hurled insults at the drunken oaf. True to his nature, Gragas replied with {{ai|Body Slam|Gragas|a diplomatic headbutt}}, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.\n\nWhen the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas' brew. Although strife was averted and Gragas hailed a hero, he still had not achieved his dream of drunken blissfulness. So once more, he set off to wander the tundra in search of ingredients for [[Runeterra]]'s perfect pint.\n\n", "title": "the Rabble Rouser"}, "Zed": {"key": "Zed", "id": 238, "name": "Zed", "background": "* {{ai|Death Mark|Zed|Shadow Blades}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Death Mark|Zed|(Plasma Cut 2250R Dual &quot;Strikers&quot;}}{{w|Alternative future|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Zed Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Ionia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Ionia|Kinkou Monastery]], [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Master of The Order of the Shadow \n*&lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiative member{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Ionia_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* The Order of the Shadow\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Syndra\n|rivals       = Shen, Akali, Kennen\n|enemies      = Gangplank, Jhin\n|related = [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Master of Shadows"}, "Vi": {"key": "Vi", "id": 254, "name": "Vi", "background": "|gender      = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race        = Human\n|birthplace  = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence   = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation  = * Member of The [[Piltover]] Police Force \n* &lt;s&gt;[[Zaun]] gang member&lt;/s&gt;\n|friends     = Caitlyn, Jayce, Ezreal\n|rivals      = Jinx\n|faction     = * [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|related     = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/mayhem-everywhere-you-look/ Mayhem everywhere you look]\n}}\n\n", "title": "the Piltover Enforcer"}, "Lulu": {"key": "Lulu", "id": 117, "name": "Lulu", "background": "* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1385.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Lulu#Pix.2C Faerie Companion|Pix]]  {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n|render = Lulu Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Formerly [[The Glade]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Sorceress\n* Trickster\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* Independent\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Gnar, Veigar\n|rivals = Tahm Kench\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The best path between two points is upside-down, between, then inside-out and round again.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lulu}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nPerhaps more than any other [[champion]] in [[the League]], Lulu marches to the beat of her own drum.\n\nDuring her youth in [[Bandle City]], she spent most of her time wandering alone in the forest or lost in a daydream. It wasn't that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn't compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked.\n\nThis was how she found {{ai|Pix, Faerie Companion|Lulu|Pix}}, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu's imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to [[the Glade]], the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods.\n\nThere the rigid properties of the outside world - things like {{ai|Wild Growth|Lulu|size}} and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place. She quickly lost track of time.\n\nHer life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were 'only pretend', and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal.\n\nLulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she'd learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away.\n\nLulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily {{ai|Whimsy|Lulu|changing}} them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn't appreciate her efforts.\n\nWhen the [[yordle]]s insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.\n\n", "title": "the Fae Sorceress"}, "Taric": {"key": "Taric", "id": 44, "name": "Taric", "background": "&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/KYpEU8rj-tarics-new-splash?comment=00010003 Reav3 confirms Taric wields a three-pronged mace]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[File:Bastion Buff.png|20px|link=]] Bastion\n|render = Taric Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]]\n|residence = [[Mount Targon]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(Protection)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;Demacian Knight&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Garen, Skarner, Sona\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/taric-comic/ The Ascent]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/taric.html Shield of Valoran]\n}}\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The best weapons are beautiful.&quot;'' - {{ci|Taric}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nTaric is the Aspect of the Protector, wielding incredible power as [[Runeterra]]'s guardian of life, love, and beauty.

The pair's unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents blind and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: not one, but two [[Demacia]]n legends.\n\nAs a young girl, Quinn shared a hunger for adventure with her twin brother. They dreamed of becoming knights, but lived a quiet, humble life in the rural borderlands of Demacia. Together they imagined triumphant battles in faraway lands, seizing glory for their king and slaying foes in the name of Demacian justice. When daydreams alone could no longer satisfy their warrior souls, they embarked on daring wilderness adventures in search of true danger. One such quest turned to tragedy when a terrible accident claimed her brother's life. Overcome with grief, Quinn abandoned her dreams of knighthood.\n\nOn the anniversary of her loss, Quinn gathered the courage to return to the scene of the tragedy. To her surprise, she found a wounded Demacian eagle at the site of her brother's death - a rare and beautiful bird long believed extinct. Quinn nursed the fledgling back to health, and as they grew up together, a deep bond formed between the two. She saw the same quality in her newfound friend that had lived within her brother, and so she gave him the name 'Valor'. The pair found strength in each other, and together they pursued the dream she had once abandoned.\n\nThe Demacian army had never seen heroes like Quinn and Valor. Their deadly skills quickly set them apart from their rank-and-file peers, but many still had their doubts. How could a common-born girl, even with such a powerful creature at her side, forego years of military training? Quinn and Valor proved themselves on one critical mission, tracking down a [[Noxus|Noxian]] assassin who had evaded an entire Demacian battalion. When they brought him to justice, they finally earned the admiration and respect of their nation. The two now serve as living, fighting icons of Demacian strength and perseverance.

Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government.\n\nIn those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power. While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus.\n\nWhen raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance.\n\nWhen LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: [[the League of Legends]].\n\n", "title": "the Deceiver"}, "Ezreal": {"key": "Ezreal", "id": 81, "name": "Ezreal", "background": "{{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nEzreal Render.png|Current\nEzreal Explorer Render.png|Explorer\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Cartographer\n* Piltover Grandmaster Explorer\n* &lt;small&gt;(Pulsefire Warrior {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux, Jayce, Caitlyn, Vi\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/pulsefire-ezreal/en.html Pulsefire Armory]\n* [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima]\n* [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\nThe intrepid young adventurer {{ci|Ezreal}} has explored some of the most remote and abandoned locations on [[Runeterra]].
