Such is the case with {{ci|Jax}}, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War.\n\nBefore joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.\n\nHis Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began. Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the [[Fields of Justice]]. The self-proclaimed 'Armsmaster of the League' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched.\n\nA number of [[summoner]]s in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable.\n\nFor this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under.\n\nThis was something the League had never done before, and something which has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways.\n\nThe League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n", "id": 24}, "Shaco": {"key": "Shaco", "name": "Shaco", "title": "the Demon Jester", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shaco\n|alias      = * The Demon Jester\n|render     = [[File:Shaco Render.png|245px|link=]]\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race       = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = * Homicidal Jester\n|faction    = * Independent\n|allies     =\n|friends    = Fiddlesticks, Nocturne\n|rivals     =\n|related    =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 35}, "Warwick": {"key": "Warwick", "name": "Warwick", "title": "the Blood Hunter", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Warwick\n|alias = The Blood Hunter\n|render = Warwick Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Werewolf &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = \n* Manhunter\n* Researcher\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Singed\n|rivals = Vayne\n|enemies = Soraka\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Eventually the beast catches up with all of us.&quot;'' - {{ci|Warwick}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWarwick was once a man revered for his ability to {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|track down}} human specimens for the darkest types of scientific research. When {{ai|Eternal Thirst|Warwick|his ambitions}} exceeded his physical limits, he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself into an unstoppable {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|manhunter}}. His newfound strength bore a heavy price.\n\nBefore his transformation, Warwick found his calling in [[Zaun]] as a 'procurer' of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner.\n\nTo meet their demands, Warwick needed the strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend, {{ci|Singed}}, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the [[Shadow Isles]], the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge.\n\nHe traveled to [[Ionia]] to trap {{ci|Soraka}}, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|raw strength}} and {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|heightened senses}}.\n\nExhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power. Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further away. He could feel himself losing control: though he always got his prey, he often failed to bring them back alive. Now he seeks the blood of Soraka to stabilize his transformation before his mind gives way to the {{ai|Hunter's Call|Warwick|feral urges}} of the beast.\n\n", "id": 19}, "Nidalee": {"key": "Nidalee", "name": "Nidalee", "title": "the Bestial Huntress", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Nidalee\n|alias       = * The Bestial Huntress\n|gender      = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|render      = [[File:Nidalee_Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|race        = Half-human, half-feline &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Hybrid transfiguring entity)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace  = Unknown\n|residence   = [[Kumungu]]\n|faction     = * Independent\n|friends     = Udyr\n|rivals      = Rengar\n|related     =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 76}, "Zyra": {"key": "Zyra", "name": "Zyra", "title": "Rise of the Thorns", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zyra\n|alias = Rise of the Thorns\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Garden of Thorns|Zyra|Seeds}}\n* {{ai|Deadly Spines|Zyra|Thorn Spitter}}\n* {{ai|Grasping Roots|Zyra|Vine Lasher}}\n|render = Zyra Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = {{ai|Stranglethorns|Zyra}} &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Fused with Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Kumungu]]\n|residence = \n|occupation = Predator\n|faction = \n* Independent \n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Maokai\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Closer to the flower, closer to the thorns.&quot;'' - {{ci|Zyra}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLonging to take control of her fate, the ancient, dying plant Zyra transferred her consciousness into a human body for a second chance at life.\n\nCenturies ago, she and her kind dominated the [[Kumungu]] Jungle, using {{ai|Deadly Spines|Zyra|thorns}} and {{ai|Grasping Roots|Zyra|vines}} to consume any animal that set foot in their territory.

She thought she would perish alone, until the appearance of an unwary sorceress presented her with an opportunity for salvation.\n\nIt was the first time in years Zyra had sensed a creature wander so close.

She saw great jungles of metal and stone where humans and animals thrived. Potent magic surged through her vines, and she devised an elegant but risky plan to survive.\n\nUsing the woman's memories, Zyra poured her newfound magic into the creation of a human-shaped vessel. She didn't know [[Runeterra|what sort of world]] awaited her, but she had nothing left to lose.\n\nWhen Zyra opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed by the raw power ready at her fingertips. It wasn't until she noticed the shriveled remains of {{ai|Stranglethorns|Zyra|the plant she once was}} that she realized how vulnerable she had become.\n\nIf this body died, there would be no network of vines to retreat through, no roots to regrow her... but she felt truly alive.

Embodying the furious bravado of his nation, he is an icon beloved by the empire's soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Tall tales such as 'The Great Hussar', 'The High General Marshal Sergeant', and 'The Mountain Admiral' trace back to the founding of the empire. Many soldiers claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has 'acquired' every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the veracity of the details is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, {{ci|Skaarl}}, Kled fights to protect what's his... and to take whatever he can get.\n\n==Lore==\nThe earliest known story of Kled traces back to the empire's infancy and the Battle of Drugne. In the dusty hills of those badlands, the First Legion was on the run from a barbarian horde. Having lost the two previous battles, the men's morale was low, the army had been forced to abandon its supply train in the rout, and they were a week's march from the nearest outpost.\n\nIn command of the Legion was a gaggle of wealthy nobles bedecked in spotless golden armor. They were more concerned with their appearances and the intrigues of their class than the men they were commanding. Worse, these commanders - though well versed in assassination and tournament fighting - had proven hopeless on the field. With the remains of the army surrounded by enemy forces, the nobles ordered the Legion into a defensive circle in hopes of negotiating ransoms for themselves.\n\nThen, as the morning sun rose, the mysterious figure of Kled appeared on the hilltop overlooking the battlefield. He rode Skaarl, an immortal desert drakalops. The mount stood on only two legs; its ear-like forelimbs fanned from the side of its head, hanging down apologetically, like a butler who had accidently dipped his hands in soup.\n\nThe lone rider stood on his steed's saddle. {{ai|Violent Tendencies|Kled|His weapon}} was rusted, his armor was worn, and his clothes were tattered - but a relentless anger burned from his one good eye.\n\n'''''&quot;I'll give you one chance to get off my land!&quot;''''' Kled announced to the barbarian horde, but the [[yordle]] didn't wait for their answer. He spurred his steed and angrily screamed {{ai|Chaaaaaaaarge!!!|Kled|his charge}}.\n\nDesperate, starving, and furious with the nobles, the Legion's anger ignited like blasting powder at the yordle's insane act of bravado. The enlisted men rushed after Kled and Skaarl as they tore into the center of the enemy formation.\n\nWhat followed was the bloodiest melee the Legion had ever fought. The initial success of its surprise attack was crushed when the barbarians' reserve forces smashed into the Legion's flanks. With the battle turning against the Noxians and the enemy attacking from every side, Skaarl [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 2.png|20px|link=]] panicked, threw Kled, and abandoned the fight. Like the cowardly lizard creature, the Noxian soldiers faltered. But at their center, Kled fought on, chopping down foes, kicking out teeth, and biting faces.\n\nEnemy bodies piled around Kled, and his clothes were soaked with blood. Despite the casualties he inflicted with every swing of his long axe, he was still forced back by the barbarians' relentless tide. He screamed louder challenges and cruder insults. Clearly, the yordle was willing to die before ever backing down.\n\nCourage and cowardice are as infectious as the plague, however, and seeing Kled's determination, the legionnaires pressed on. Even Skaarl stopped running and turned to watch the Legion's last stand.\n\nThen, as the Noxian line was breaking and the enemy's superior numbers pulled Kled to the ground, the drakalops triumphantly [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 3.png|20px|link=]] returned and crashed into the barbarians' rear. Snarling and clawing, it dove into the churning melee until it freed its master. With his mount again beneath him, the reinvigorated Kled became a whirlwind of death, and it was the barbarians who broke and ran.\n\nThough precious few of the Noxian soldiers survived, the battle was won. The tribes of Drugne were defeated, and their lands were added to the empire. The bodies of the nobles, and their fine golden armor, were never found.\n\nIn time, most of the empire's other legions acquired similar stories of Kled, proving no defeat is certain in the face of insane courage. It is said he rides wherever the legions travel, claiming the spoils of war and land for himself and Skaarl.\n\nMost Noxians find the truth of these tall tales questionable at best. But in the legions' wake, signs can always be found proclaiming each new territory 'Property of Kled'.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe Northern Steppes ain't the place for fancy undies and golden piss pots. It's tough land. Ain't nothing go here but barbarian raiders, poison grass, and harsh winds. To survive, you gotta eat rocks and crap lava. And I'm the toughest, meanest, killingest bastard in these parts. So I figure that makes these plains mine.\n\n'''''&quot;But how did I end up here? And why am I alone with yer dumb yella hide?&quot;''''' I say out loud, starting it off again.\n\nSkaarl snorts her response from the rock she's sunning herself on. Her scales is dark metal with hints of gold. Ain't nothing can break that drakalops' skin. I've seen a steel sword shatter against her leg.\n\nDon't make her farts smell any better though.\n\n'''''&quot;I'm callin' you a damn coward. You got somethin' to say about that?&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglarg&quot;''''', it says as it looks up and yawns.\n\n'''''&quot;It was a hooked grouse! No bigger than my hand. And you run... Darn dumb, stupid animal!&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Greef... rglarg?&quot;''''' Skaarl asks as it swats the flies away from its half-opened eyes.\n\n'''''&quot;Oh, good retort! Yeah, real funny, right? Ha ha ha! I'm damn tired of yer heretical pontifications. I should leave ya here to die. That's what I should do. You'd die o' loneliness. Hell, you wouldn't last a day without me.&quot;'''''\n\nSkaarl lays its head back down on the rock.\n\nThere ain't no use communicating with her. I should forgive her - but then, and no doubt to mock me, her sphincter splutters rhythmically as she breaks wind. The smell hits me like a frying pan.\n\n'''''&quot;That's it, you bastard!&quot;''''' I throw my stinking hat onto the ground and march away from the campsite, swearing I'll never set eyes on that foul-mouthed drakalops again. 'Course, it was my good hat, so I have to trot back and snatch it off the ground.\n\n'''''&quot;Yeah, keep sleeping, ya lazy flaprat&quot;''''', I say as I walk away. '''''&quot;I'll do the patrol!&quot;'''''\n\nBeing ten moons from any farmstead don't preclude doing the patrol. It's my land. And I aim to keep it that way. With or without that treason-ish lizard's help.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe sun's dragging its way down to the horizon by the time I reach the hills. This time of day, the light plays tricks on you. I meet a snake who wants to discuss pie crusts. Except it ain't a snake, it's the shadow of a rock.\n\nDamn shame. I have some durn specific notions about pie crusts. At least when I remember what they are again. I ain't had a proper conversation about the subject in years.\n\nI'm about to take a swig of my mushroom juice and explain my views to the snake, when I hear them.\n\nDrake hounds howling and braying. It's the sounds those beasts make when they is herding elmarks. And if there's elmarks, then there is humans. And those humans is trespassers.\n\nI scramble up a nearby boulder and check north first.\n\nThe rolling hills of my grasslands is empty, save for the iron buttes scattered across the horizon. The braying sounds might be the mushroom juice playing tricks on my head... But then I turn south.\n\nThey is about a half day's walk from this hill. Three hundred elmarks grazing. Grazing on my land.\n\nThe drake hounds circle around the herd, but there's no horses. A few humans walk around them on foot. Humans don't like walking. So it don't take a genius to figure they must be part of some larger convoy then. 'Course, I am a genius. So that was easy to figure.\n\nMy blood begins to boil. That means more damn trespassers, disturbing my peace. Here, when I was about to have a lovely conversation about pie crusts with that snake.\n\nI take another sip of mush-juice and head back to the campsite.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\n'''''&quot;Get up, lizard!&quot;''''' I say as I grab my saddle.\n\nIt raises its head, grunts a response, and returns to lying in the cool grass.\n\n'''''&quot;Get up! Get up! GIT UP!&quot;''''' I yell. '''''&quot;There's trespassers, invading the peaceful serenity of our environs.&quot;'''''\n\nIt looks at me blankly. I forget sometimes she don't understand me when I'm speaking.\n\nI buckle the saddle onto its back. '''''&quot;There's humans on our land!&quot;'''''\n\nIt stands, and its ears perk up nervously. Humans. That word it knows. I jump into the saddle.\n\n'''''&quot;Let's get those humans!&quot;''''' I roar, indicating our southward destination. But the damn beast immediately starts going north.\n\n'''''&quot;No, No, NO! They's that way! That way!&quot;''''' I say, using my reins to pull the cowardly beast back in the right direction.\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglaaarg!&quot;''''' the drakalops cries as it kicks off. In an instant, she's running. The insane speed of it makes my eyes close. Scrub grass whips painfully against my legs. A cloud of dust billows behind us. What'd take me half a day of walking is past before I can get my hat tied down.\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglorg!&quot;''''' the drakalops screeches.\n\n'''''&quot;Now, don't be like that! Weren't you saying you wanted company last night?&quot;'''''\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe sun is just starting to dip below the horizon when we reach the herd. I slow Skaarl to a trot as we approach the humans' campsite. They'd already started a fire and have a stew going.\n\n'''''&quot;Hold, stranger. Show your hands before you approach&quot;''''', a human in a red hat says. Their leader, I figure.\n\nI slowly take my hands off the reins. But instead of putting them up, I pull {{ai|Violent Tendencies|Kled|my long axe}} from its saddle loop.\n\n'''''&quot;I don't think you understand me, old timer&quot;''''', the human in the red hat says again. His fellows ready weapons: swords, lassos, and a dozen repeater crossbows.\n\n'''''&quot;I got it under control&quot;''''', I tell my lizard, before turning my attention back to the humans. '''''&quot;I ain't impressed with your fancy, city-folk weapons. Now I'm giving you one warning. Get off my land. Or else.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Or else what?&quot;''''' a younger human asks.\n\n'''''&quot;You boys best know who you're dealing with&quot;''''', I say. '''''&quot;This is Skaarl. She's a drakalops. And I'm Kled, Lord Major Admiral of the Second Legion's forward artillery - cavalry multiplication.&quot;'''''\n\nSeveral of the humans start snickering. I'll learn them soon enough - once I'm done talking.\n\n'''''&quot;And what makes you think this is your land?&quot;''''' asks the human in the red hat, smirking.\n\n'''''&quot;It's mine. I took it from them barbarians.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;It's property of Lord Vakhul. He was granted it by the High Command. It's his by rightful dispensation.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Well, High Command! Why didn't you say so?!&quot;''''' I say before spitting on the ground. '''''&quot;The only law a true [[Noxus|Noxian]] respects is strength. He can have it. If he can take it from me.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;You and your pony best be moving on, while you still can.&quot;'''''\n\nI forget sometimes humans don't see us like we see them. It's the last straw though.\n\n'''''{{ai|Chaaaaaaaarge!!!|Kled|&quot;CHARGE!!!!&quot;}}''''' I scream, and snap the reins. The drakalops kicks off, and we rush them. I meant to make a clever retort first, but I got ahead of myself.\n\nThe humans let loose their first volley, but Skaarl raises her ears. Like giant bronze fans, they shield us as the crossbow bolts ricochet off her impenetrable flesh.\n\nShe roars happily as we dive through their camp at the leader in the red hat. Swords clang against Skaarl's hide, while my axe swings. I turn two of them humans into confetti. The bastard in the red hat's quick. He ducks under my blade as we pass by. Another volley of crossbow bolts hits us.\n\nSkaarl screams in fear. Damn thing's unkillable and immortal, but easily spooked. Problem with magical beasties, they don't make no sense.\n\nI yank the reins, and we ride back into the middle of the humans. I easily kill the rest of his men, but the red-hat bastard's a tough one. My blade slams into him - but the blow clangs dully against his heavy breast plate. That should give him something to think about, anyway.\n\nThat's when the ballista fires. The bolt is longer than a wagon. It smashes into the drakalops, knocking my long axe from my hand, and sends us rolling to the ground. Skaarl ain't hurt. But she shakes me off the saddle and [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 2.png|20px|link=]] runs for the hills.\n\n'''''&quot;You ungrateful bastard! We had the frassa-gimps in the razabutts!&quot;''''' I mean to scream more insults, but my words start tripping over themselves.\n\nI roll to my feet. Dust and grass cover my face. I throw my hat toward the cowardly lizard's path, then turn back to kill the man in the red hat.\n\nBut behind him, on the hill line, is another hundred of them humans. Iron warriors, bloodrunners, and a wagon-mounted ballista. Red-hatted blurf-herder brought most of a legion with him.\n\n'''''&quot;You ain't nothing but a durn sneaky-sneak!&quot;''''' I scream.\n\n'''''&quot;You don't look like much&quot;''''', he says, '''''&quot;but I guess you're the one who's been giving Lord Vakhul's ranchers so much trouble.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Vakhul ain't no real Noxian. Your lordship can kiss my lizard's puckered mudflap!&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Maybe I'll let you end your days in Lord Vakhul's fighting pits. If you can learn to keep your mouth shut.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;I'm gonna rip your lips off and use them to wipe my butt!&quot;''''' I roar.\n\nI guess he don't like that, 'cause him and his hundred friends start running at me, weapons drawn. I could run. But I don't. They'll pay dearly to kill me.\n\nRed Hat's fast. He's nearly on me before I can recover my weapon from the ground. His blade is high. He's got the killing stroke. But I've got {{ai|Pocket Pistol|Kled|my hidden scattergun}}.\n\nThe blast sends him to the ground. It knocks me back, too. I tumble end over end. The single shot buys me some time. But not much.\n\nThe bloodrunners are closing fast. Their hooked blades is ready. I'm gonna die in this turd-stain. Well, if it's my last stand, might as well make it a good one.\n\nI dust myself off as the first line of bloodrunners attacks. I'm carving those dark magical bastards apart, but they're cutting me to ribbons. I'm beginning to tire from the effort and loss of blood.\n\nThen the iron warriors scream their battle cries, as they charge in their thick black armor. They've split into two groups, doing one of those 'pinching' maneuvers. Plan on using those two walls of metal to crush me flatter than a Noxian coin.\n\nDamn it.\n\nAny hope I got of surviving this, it's gone...\n\nAnd that's when I see her. The most loyal, trustworthy, honorable friend an undeserving bastard like me could ever have.\n\n[[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 3.png|20px|link=]] Skaarl.\n\nRiding like hell toward me. Faster than I've ever seen her run. A rooster tail of dust is shooting up behind her. The damn lizard even picks up my hat on her way to me. I run to her just as those black-clad warriors are about to crush me.\n\nI leap into the saddle, and we circle around the iron warriors.

As was his people's way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. \n\nTrekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered in ancient runes. Though the meaning of the runes was long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. Inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren's song, captivating and seductive. \n\nWhile the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his hand...\n\n[[File:Kegan Rodhe.jpg|center|400px]]\n\nThat is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand. It is a creature of olden times - perhaps even a casualty of the Rune Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It is a creature of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste to the world of men and [[yordle]]s. \n\nNo one is quite sure how Brand found his way to [[Valoran]], but he began his predations at once. Overcome by [[Demacia]]n forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of [[the League]] or die.

Protected by a spiked shell, Rammus inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes - from [[Ascended|demigod]], to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the desert.\n== Lore ==\n\nSome believe {{ci|Rammus}} is an [[Ascended]] being, an ancient god amongst men who rolls to [[Shurima|Shurima\u2019s]] aid as an armored guardian in its times of need. Superstitious folk swear he is a harbinger of change, appearing when the land is on the verge of a great shift in power. Others speculate he is the last of a dying species that roamed the land before the Rune Wars sundered the desert with uncontrolled magic.\n\nWith so many rumors of great power, magic, and mystery surrounding him, Rammus compels many Shurimans to seek his wisdom. Soothsayers, priests, and deranged lunatics alike claim to know where Rammus dwells, but the Armordillo has proved elusive. Despite this, proof of his presence predates living memory, with crumbling mosaics depicting his image on the most ancient walls of Shuriman ruins. His likeness adorns colossal stone monuments made in the early days of Ascension, leading some to believe he is no less than an immortal demigod. Skeptics often point to a simpler explanation: that Rammus is just one of many such creatures.\n\nIt is said that he appears only to worthy pilgrims in great need of his aid, and those blessed by his presence experience great turning points. After the Armordillo rescued the heir to a vast kingdom from a terrible fire, the man renounced his position to become a goat farmer. An elderly mason was inspired by a profound, yet brief conversation with Rammus, and constructed an enormous marketplace which became the bustling heart of Nashramae.\n\nKnowing Rammus\u2019s guidance can pave an enlightened path, devout believers perform elaborate rituals designed to attract the favor of their deity. Disciples of the cult devoted to Rammus demonstrate their unwavering faith in a yearly ceremony by imitating his famous roll and somersaulting through the city in droves. Every year, thousands of Shurimans trek through the most treacherous and remote corners of the desert on a quest to find Rammus, for many teachings indicate he will answer a single question of those he finds deserving, if they are able to find him. Knowing his enthusiasm for desert treats, the pilgrims arm themselves with offerings thought to attract his blessing, packing their mules with flasks of sweet goat\u2019s milk, chests filled with colonies of ants sealed in wax, and jars of honeycombs. Many never return from the deep desert, and fewer still with stories of the demigod, though travelers describe waking to find their packs mysteriously emptied of all edible provisions.\n\nWhether he is truly a wise oracle, Ascended deity, or a mighty beast, Rammus is known for his miraculous feats of endurance. He entered the impenetrable Fortress of Siram, an imposing bastion designed by a crazed sorcerer. The structure was said to contain untold magical horrors - fearsome beasts mutated beyond recognition, corridors wreathed in flames, impenetrable tunnels guarded by shadow demons. Not an hour had passed when the enormous fortress collapsed in a plume of dust, and Rammus was seen rolling away. None knew why Rammus entered the darkened gate, nor what secrets he learned within the basalt walls of the fortress. In the year of the great flood he crossed the vast lake of Imalli in just two days, and dug many miles deep to destroy a giant anthill and kill its queen, whose daughters had devastated the nearby farmland.\n\nSometimes he appears as a benevolent hero. When invading [[Noxus|Noxian]] warbands attacked a Northern Shuriman settlement, disparate tribes banded together to defend the territory beneath the Temple of the Ascended. They were no match for the invaders in size or skill, and the battle was all but lost when Rammus entered the fray. Each side was so shocked to see the elusive creature that fighting halted completely as they watched him roll between them. As Rammus passed the towering temple, the foundations of the building shook, and enormous stone blocks toppled onto the invading army, crushing many of its warriors. Now outnumbered, the army retreated to elated cheers from the Shurimans. While many swear Rammus saved the town out of love for Shurima, others argue he was merely defending the territory in which his favorite cactus flowers grew. At least one tribesman claims Rammus was simply sleeprolling and had no intention of taking down a temple.\n\nWhatever the truth, stories of Rammus are treasured by the people of Shurima. Any Shuriman child can list a dozen theories on the question of his origin, half of which they likely invented on the spot. Tales of the Armordillo have only increased with the rise of Ancient Shurima, as they did just before its fall, giving way to a belief that his presence heralds darker times to come.\n\nBut how can such a benevolent, epicurean soul herald an age of destruction?\n\n", "id": 33}, "Illaoi": {"key": "Illaoi", "name": "Illaoi", "title": "the Kraken Priestess", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Illaoi\n|render = Illaoi Render.png\n|alias = \n* The Kraken Priestess\n* Truth Bearer of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|Eye of God}}\n* {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Buhru, [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]]\n|residence = Rat Town, [[Bilgewater]]\n|occupation = \n* Priestess of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n* &lt;small&gt;(Void Bringer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Bilgewater Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Bilgewater]]\n* [[File:Illaoi Relic.png|20px|link=]] Nagakabouros\n|allies = \n|friends = Gangplank, Miss Fortune, Graves, Twisted Fate\n|enemies = Nautilus, Hecarim, Mordekaiser, Yorick, Thresh, Karthus\n|related = \n*[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/champions/trial-of-the-kraken-priestess Trial of the Kraken Priestess]\n* [[Shadow and Fortune]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head.&quot;'' - {{ci|Illaoi}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIllaoi's powerful physique is dwarfed only by her indomitable faith.

All who challenge the 'Truth Bearer of Nagakabouros' soon discover Illaoi never battles alone - the god of the [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]] fights by her side.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Illaoi Relic.png|center|200px]]\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;There can be no rest. We are the motion.&quot;'' - from 'The Twenty Wisdoms of Nagakabouros'&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAll who encounter Illaoi are struck by her presence. An intense woman, the priestess is fully committed to the experience of living. She takes what she wants, destroys what she hates, and revels in everything she loves.\n\nHowever, to truly know Illaoi you must understand the religion she has devoted her life to. {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}, the deity of her faith, is usually depicted as an enormous serpent head with tentacles spiraling around it in endless motion, with no beginning and no end. Also called The Mother Serpent, The Great Kraken, or even The Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros is the Serpent Isles' god of life, ocean storms, and motion (the literal translation of its name is 'the unending monster that drives the sea and sky') Central to the religion's theology are three tenets: every spirit was born to serve the universe; desire was built into every living being by the universe; the universe only moves toward its destiny when living creatures chase their desires.\n\nLesser priestesses are tasked with maintaining temples, calling holy serpents, and teaching people the ways of Nagakabouros. As the religion's Truth Bearer, Illaoi's role is to serve the god directly by unblocking the flow of the universe. To this end, she has two sacred responsibilities.\n\nThe first duty of a Truth Bearer is to be the spearhead in the war against [[Shadow Isles|undeath]]. Having fallen outside of the normal flow of the universe, the undead are considered an abomination against Nagakabouros. While it is the responsibility of every priestess of the Kraken to protect the indigenous population from the [[Harrowing]], a Truth Bearer directly engages its most powerful spirits and drives the Black Mist back.\n\nSecond, Illaoi is tasked with seeking out individuals of great potential and challenging them with the {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi|Test of Nagakabouros}}. This task is the burden Illaoi's title reflects. With her massive, holy relic, {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|The Eye of God}}, the Truth Bearer strips the subject's spirit from their body then forces them to {{ai|Vessel|Illaoi|stand against her}} to prove their worth. She does this knowing those who fail will be completely annihilated, for the great Kraken has no tolerance for cowardice, doubt, or restraint. But destruction is never the goal. Survivors of the ordeal are forever changed and often find the will to pursue their true destiny.\n\nThough Illaoi is the most powerful and respected Truth Bearer in a hundred generations, it is where she has broken the traditions of her faith that speaks the most about her. Having completed her training as a Truth Bearer, and at the height of her power, Illaoi left the golden temples of Buhru for the squalor of nearby [[Bilgewater]].\n\nThe pirate city is the only place foreigners are permitted on the Serpent Isles, viewed as a fetid gutter by Illaoi's people. Previous Truth Bearers ignored the city and viewed the arriving foreigners as little better than untouchables. [[Shadow and Fortune|Illaoi broke with tradition when she chose to protect residents of Bilgewater from the Harrowing]], or even more controversially when she decided that some of its residents had souls worthy of the great test. Despite this, only a handful of temples have been opened in the city, and very few ''paylangi'' (islander slang for residents of mainlander descent) have ever been permitted inside.\n\nRegardless, it is Illaoi who has brought the widespread awareness of the Mother Serpent to Bilgewater, and it is her indomitable spirit that has brought her religion into favor there.\n\nRumors persist that {{ci|Gangplank|Bilgewater's most bloodthirsty and infamous pirate}} had his heart broken by the towering priestess. To anyone who has ever met her, this is no surprise. Illaoi's rough manner belies subtle intelligence, strength, and a magnetic confidence.\n\nMany seek Illaoi's favor and welcome her to Bilgewater... yet everyone fears being tested by the Kraken's Prophet.\n\n;The Burden\n''&quot;Truth Bearer, this is why we must retreat to Buhru. We cannot save the'' paylangi''&quot;'', the Hierophant said. The heavy-set woman grinned, obviously pleased by the prospect of leaving Bilgewater.\n\n''&quot;You've mentioned that before&quot;'', {{ci|Illaoi}} said, walking around the stone table in the center of the room. She rolled her shoulders, loosening the muscles to fight off a yawn.\n\nBeside the Hierophant, an elderly serpent caller stood. He wore a vestment made from ropes. Each indigo-dyed cord had been woven to curl; their varying thicknesses and faded kraken ink gave him the illusion of being draped in rough-hewn tentacles. His face was completely covered by a black tattoo depicting the endless teeth of a leviathan's maw. ''Monks and serpent callers were always trying to look scary. It was an annoying habit of most men.''\n\n''&quot;The greatest beasts won't approach [[Bilgewater]]&quot;'', the serpent caller said with a wheeze. ''&quot;They stay out in the deep water, away from the stench of the Slaughter Docks. At best, a few half-starved younglings will heed our summons.&quot;''\n\nOnly the greatest children of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}} were strong enough to consume the mists and defend the city from the [[Harrowing]]. The rest of the [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]] didn't have this problem.\n\nIt was yet another reminder of the ignorance of Bilgewater's population. The mainlanders and their descendants didn't give time for fresh water to flow through and clean their docks. Instead, the ''paylangi'' settled permanent anchorages around every shore in the bay. It was so foolish. Many of the priesthood asserted it was proof the ''paylangi'' actually wanted to be consumed by the Black Mists.\n\n''&quot;Crap&quot;'', Illaoi said. If she was going to stay, she would have to find a way to defend the city without serpents. She picked at the food from one of the offering bowls around her, before selecting a mango. She needed a plan, and these two fools were useless.\n\nA loud crack interrupted her musing. A heavy, wooden door had slammed open downstairs.\n\n{{ci|Gangplank}}'s voice howled, the words were unintelligible, echoing around the stone walls.\n\n''&quot;We pulled him from the water, as you commanded&quot;'', the Hierophant smiled, adjusting the jade collar of her office. ''&quot;Perhaps it would have been better to let his energy return to Nagakabouros?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You do not judge souls.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course Truth Bearer, it is for'' Nagakabouros ''to judge&quot;'', he said, implying that Illaoi's opinion was biased.\n\nIllaoi walked between the two clerics, dwarfing the pair of them. Even for an islander, the Truth Bearer was tall. It had always been so. She was taller even than the largest Northman. As a girl, she had been self-conscious about it, always feeling like she was stumbling into people, but she had learned. ''When I move, they should know enough to get out of my way.''\n\nShe lifted the {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|Eye of God}} from its stand. The golden idol was larger than a wine barrel and many times the weight. Her fingers tingled against its cold metal. It had been placed next to the giant roaring fire, which illuminated the room, but the Eye of God stayed forever cool and damp to the touch. Illaoi deftly shouldered its massive weight. In a dozen years, the Truth Bearer had never been more than two strides from it.\n\n''&quot;Hierophant, I remember my duties&quot;'', Illaoi said as she headed down the stairs. ''&quot;We will not be retreating to Buhru. I will stop the Harrowing here.&quot;''\n\nThe high priestess had done little but complain since arriving from Buhru, but there was some truth in her words.\n\n[[Burning Tides|When Gangplank's ship had exploded]], Illaoi's heart had jumped. It had been many years since they had laid together, many years since she had ended the relationship... but some feelings still lingered. She had loved him once... stupid, old bastard.\n\nSurrounded by tall walls of interlocking stones, the courtyard to the temple was shaped like the fanged mouth of a leviathan. The entrance looked over the blue waters of the bay far below. Illaoi stomped down the stairway toward the front gate. She assumed she would have to smack Gangplank in the mouth; he was prone to arrogance and rum. But still, it would be nice to see him.\n\nShe was unprepared for the snarling creature in her temple's entrance. She knew he had been injured, but not like this. He was limping badly and bent over from shattered ribs. He cradled what was left of his arm.\n\n{{ai|Parrrley|Gangplank|He swung a pistol}} around the room with his other arm, in a half-mad attempt to force the monks and priestesses to back away from him; oblivious to the fact that these were the very people who had pulled his drowned body from the bay only a few hours ago. Worse, his pistol was clearly empty and completely useless.\n\n''&quot;Where is Illaoi?&quot;'' he bellowed.\n\n''&quot;I'm here, Gangplank&quot;'', she answered. ''&quot;You look like crap.&quot;''\n\nHe fell to his knees.\n\n''&quot;It was {{ci|Miss Fortune}}. Had to be. Working with those two {{ci|Graves|alley}} {{ci|Twisted Fate|whores}}. They sank it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not care about your warship&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;You were always telling me to move on, to head back out to sea. I needed a boat.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You need only a canoe for the sea.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is my town!&quot;'' he screamed.\n\nThe monks and priestesses surrounding Gangplank tensed at this outburst. That Gangplank was foolish enough to make such a claim while standing in a structure thousands of years older than his city, was dangerous in itself. But a ''paylangi'' shouting at the thrice-blessed Truth Bearer in her own temple? ''Any other man would've been dumped into the sea with broken knees.''\n\n''&quot;It's my town!&quot;'' he roared again. Spittle flew from his mouth in rage.\n\n''&quot;So what are you gonna do about it?&quot;'' Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;I, I need Okao and the other chiefs' support. They'll listen to you... if you ask them. If you ask them, they'll help me.&quot;'' He lowered his head in front of her.\n\n''&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;'' Illaoi said, raising her voice this time.\n\n''&quot;What can I do?&quot;'' he said hopelessly. ''&quot;She took my ship, she took my men, she took my arm. Anything I had left... I used to get here.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Leave us&quot;'', Illaoi told the other priests as she walked toward the gate. She looked down on Gangplank. It had been ten years since she'd last seen him; drink and worry had taken his dashing looks.\n\n''&quot;There is nothing for me but this town, and without your help...&quot;'' his voice trailed off when he met her gaze. Illaoi kept her eyes as hard and unforgiving as the Kraken. She gave Gangplank nothing. The priestess of Nagakabouros could show no pity or sympathy, even if it tore at her chest. In despair, the old captain's eyes darted away from hers.\n\n''&quot;I could do that&quot;'', Illaoi said, ''&quot;and with a word, the tribes and Okao's gang would join you. But why should I?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Help me, damn it! You owe me&quot;'', he snapped like a child.\n\n''&quot;I'' owe ''you?&quot;'' Illaoi rolled the words in her mouth.\n\n''&quot;I keep up the rituals. I offer the sacrifices&quot;'', Gangplank snarled.\n\n''&quot;But clearly you did not learn the lesson. Rituals? Sacrifices? You speak of things for weak men and their weak gods. My god demands action&quot;'', Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;I suffered for this town! Bled for it. It is mine by right!&quot;''\n\nIllaoi knew what she had to do. She knew it before Gangplank had spoken. She had known years before his ship had sunk.\n\nGangplank had strayed. For too long, he had festered in the hatred and self-pity his father had beaten into him. Illaoi had ignored her duty. She had ignored it because she had loved him, once, and because she had led him down this path when she left him. He had been content as a killer, a corsair, a true pirate, and never interested in his father's title of Reaver King.\n\nHe had only set anchor in his bloody quest to become the lord of Bilgewater after they had parted ways.\n\nIllaoi felt a dampness in her eyes. His time had passed. He had been unable to move forward. To advance. To evolve. And now? Now he would not survive the {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi|Test of Nagakabouros}}. But he needed to be tested. He was here to be tested.\n\nIllaoi looked at the old pirate before her. ''Could I send him away? Trust that he still has some sliver of strength or ambition that might see him through? If I send him away, he might live, at least... ''\n\nThat was not the way of Nagakabouros. That was not the role of a Truth Bearer. This was not the place for doubts or second-guessing. If she trusted her god, she must trust her instincts. If she felt he had to be tested, then it was her god's will. ''And what fool would choose a man over a god?''\n\nGripping the Eye of God's handle tightly, Illaoi lowered the heavy gold icon from her shoulder. A familiar lightness replaced it, yet somehow she could still feel its weight there.\n\n''&quot;Please&quot;'', Gangplank begged. ''&quot;Show me some kindness, at least.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I will show you the truth&quot;'', Illaoi said, steeling her will.\n\nShe stomp-kicked Gangplank, her heel smashing into his nose with a crunch. He flew backward like a drunkard, blood pouring down his lip. He rolled over and looked up at her with furious eyes.\n\n''{{sbc|&quot;Behold!&quot;}}'' Illaoi intoned.\n\nShe reached out with her mind and called forth the energy of the Mother Serpent as she swung the giant idol forward. A glowing mist vomited from the icon's mouth and swirls of blue-green energy formed around the Mother Serpent's face, solidifying into {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|ghostly tentacles}}. Touched by gold, these tendrils were as beautiful as the sunrise over water, and as horrifying as the darkest undersea abomination. More tentacles grew from the icon, replicating around the room as if born from some unknowable mathematics. Exponentially they grew larger, and somehow each one's growth seemed to hold all the promise and horror of the world.\n\n''&quot;No!&quot;'' Gangplank screamed. But the whirlwind ignored his cries as the storm of tentacles took him.\n\n''&quot;Face Nagakabouros!&quot;'' she yelled. ''&quot;Prove yourself!&quot;'' The tentacles grasped at Gangplank, then dived into his chest. He shuddered as ghostly images of his past lives shook around him.\n\nHe screamed as his soul was ripped from his body. {{ai|Vessel|Illaoi|His doppelganger}} stood unmoving before Illaoi. The spirit of Gangplank smoldered an almost blinding blue, its body crackling and flickering through his previous lives.\n\nThe mass of tentacles attacked the wounded captain. Gangplank rolled and stumbled to his feet, dodging what he could. But for each one that missed, more and more appeared. Reality twisted and churned around him. The swarm of tentacles crashed against him, pushing him down, pulling him further and further from his soul - toward oblivion.\n\nIllaoi wanted to look away. More than anything, she wanted to turn her eyes. ''It is my duty to witness his passing. He was a great man, but he has failed. The universe demands--- ''\n\nGangplank rose. Slowly, inexorably, and unrelentingly he forced his broken body to stand. He ripped himself from the mass of tentacles and advanced step by painstaking step, roaring through the agony. Bloody and exhausted, he finally stood in front of Illaoi. His eyes bulged with hate and pain, but full of purpose. With his final ounce of strength, he walked into the glowing visage of his spirit.\n\n''&quot;I will be king.&quot;''\n\nThe wind fell still. The tentacles ruptured in bursts of light. Nagakabouros was satisfied.\n\n''&quot;You are in motion&quot;'', Illaoi smiled.\n\nGangplank stood inches from his former love - glaring at her. His back arched and his chest swelled with the sweet air of resolve - he was the proud captain once more.\n\nGangplank turned and walked away from her, no less injured or limping, but his stride now held its familiar boldness.\n\n''&quot;Next time I ask for help, just say no&quot;'', Gangplank growled.\n\n''&quot;Do something about that arm&quot;'', Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;Was nice to see you&quot;'', he said as he walked out of the temple and down the long steps toward the water below.\n\n''&quot;Stupid old bastard&quot;'', she grinned.\n\nAs the monks and hierophant returned to the antechamber, Illaoi remembered there were a thousand things she needed to do. A thousand little burdens she needed to carry. The Truth Bearer would have to meet with {{ci|Miss Fortune|Sarah Fortune}}. Illaoi suspected Nagakabouros would soon need to test the bounty hunter.\n\n''&quot;Tell Okao and the chiefs to support Gangplank&quot;'', Illaoi said to the hierophant. ''&quot;Help him retake the city.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The city is in chaos, many want his head.

What yordles lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness. Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF). Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over [[Valoran]], surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.\n\nCorki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness. Before [[the League]], he served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions which would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good {{w|dogfight}} in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement which he felt 'cut the engines and clipped the wings'. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him. When Heimerdinger joined the [[League of Legends]], it was no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test his mettle against the best the world has to offer.\n\n", "id": 42}, "Braum": {"key": "Braum", "name": "Braum", "title": "the Heart of the Freljord", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Braum\n|alias = The Heart of the Freljord \n|render = Braum Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Iceborn]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Freljord]]\n|residence = \n|occupation = \n* Goat Herder \n* Legendary Tale Hero \n* &lt;small&gt;(Wrestler {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord_Avarosan.png|15px|link=]] [[Avarosan]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; (Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Ashe, Tryndamere, Gragas \n|rivals = Lissandra\n|related = \n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/braum/ The Feats of Braum]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/trials-poro/ Trials of the Poro]\n}}\n\n", "background": "=Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\nMain=\n\n[[File:The Heart of the Freljord.png|left|250px]]\n\n''&quot;Would you like a bedtime story?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Grandma, I'm too old for that.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You're never too old to be told a story.&quot;''\n\nThe girl reluctantly crawls into bed and waits, knowing she won't win this battle. A bitter wind howls outside, whipping falling snow into devil whirls.\n\n''&quot;What kind? A tale of {{ci|Lissandra|the Ice Witch}}, perhaps?&quot;'' her grandmother asks.\n\n''&quot;No, not her.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What about a story of {{ci|Braum}}?&quot;'' She was met with silence. The old woman smiles. ''&quot;Oh, there are so many. My grandmother used to tell me of the time Braum protected our village from the great dragon! Or once - this was long ago - he raced down a river of lava! Or -'' She pauses; puts a finger to her lips. ''Have I told you how Braum got {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum|his shield}}?&quot;''\n\nThe girl shakes her head. The hearth fire snaps, holding off the wind.\n\n''&quot;Well. In the mountains above our village lived a man named Braum - &quot;''\n\n''&quot;I know that!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He mostly kept to his farm, tending his sheep and goats, but he was the kindest man anyone had ever met, and he always had a smile on his face and a laugh on his lips.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Now, one day something terrible happened: a young troll boy around your age was climbing the mountain and happened on a vault, set into the mountainside, the entrance guarded by a huge stone  door with a shard of True Ice at its center. When he opened the door, he couldn't believe his eyes: the vault was filled with gold, jewels - every kind of treasure you could imagine!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What he didn't know was that the vault was a trap. {{ci|Lissandra|The Ice Witch}} had cursed it - and as the troll boy entered, the magical door {{sbc|clanged}} shut behind him and locked him inside! Try as he might, he couldn't get out.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A passing shepherd heard his cries. Everyone rushed to help, but even the strongest warriors couldn't open the door. The boy's parents were beside themselves; his mother's wails of grief echoed around the mountain. It seemed hopeless.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And then, to everyone's surprise, they heard a distant laugh.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It was Braum, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Aren't you clever! Braum had heard their cries and came striding down the mountainside. The villagers told him of the troll boy and the curse. Braum smiled, nodded, turned to the vault, and faced the door. He pushed it. Pulled it. Punched it; kicked it; tried to rip it from its hinges. But the door wouldn't budge.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But he's the strongest man ever!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It was perplexing&quot;'', her grandmother agrees. ''&quot;For four days and nights, Braum sat on a boulder, trying to think of a solution. After all, a child's life was at stake.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then, as the sun rose on the fifth day, his eyes widened and a broad grin lit up his face. 'If I can't go through the door', he said, 'then I'll just have to go through - ' &quot;''\n\nThe girl thinks; her own eyes widen. ''&quot; ' - the mountain!' &quot;''\n\n''&quot; 'The mountain'. Braum headed to the summit and began punching his way straight down, pummeling into the stone, fist after fist, rocks flying in his wake, until he had vanished deep into the mountain.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;As the villagers held their breath, the rock around the door crumbled - and when the dust cleared, they saw Braum standing amidst the treasure, the weak but happy troll boy in his arms.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I knew he could do it!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But before they could celebrate, everything began to rumble and shake: Braum's tunnel had weakened the mountaintop, and now it was caving in! Thinking quickly, Braum grabbed the enchanted  door and held it above him like a shield, protecting them as the mountaintop collapsed all around them. When it was over, Braum was amazed: there wasn't a single scratch on the door! Braum knew it was something very special.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And from that moment on, that magical shield never left Braum's side.&quot;''\n\nThe girl is sitting upright, struggling to conceal her excitement. Her grandmother waits. She shrugs and gets up to leave.\n\n''&quot;Grandma&quot;'', the girl stops her, ''&quot;can you tell me another?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;'' Her grandmother smiles; kisses her forehead; blows out the candle.

Sensing a growing corruption of the land itself, Anivia joins the [[File:ProfileIcon Avarosan.png|20px|link=]] Avarosan in the belief that a united Freljord can defeat the coming darkness.\n\nAnivia is a being of the coldest winter, a mystical embodiment of ice magic, and an ancient protector of the Freljord. She commands all the power and fury of the land itself, calling {{ai|Glacial Storm|Anivia|the snow and bitter wind}} to defend her home from those who would harm it. A benevolent but mysterious creature, Anivia is eternally bound to keep vigil over the Freljord through life, death, and {{ai|Rebirth|Anivia|rebirth}}.\n\nAnivia is as much a part of the Freljord as the never-ending frost. Long before mortals had ever set foot on the land's frigid tundra, she had lived countless lifetimes and died as many deaths. The beginnings and ends of her eternal cycle always heralded great change, from the calming of raging storms to the ebb and flow of ice ages. It is said that when the cryophoenix dies, an era ends; and when she is reborn, a new era begins.\n\nThough Anivia's past lifetimes have faded from her memory, she knows her purpose: she must protect the Freljord at all costs.\n\nWhen she was last reborn, Anivia witnessed the rise of a mighty and united human tribe. She guarded their lands with pride as they prospered, but such unity could not last forever. The great tribe fractured into three, and after that upheaval, Anivia watched the people of the Freljord become embroiled in battle. As she strove to calm the turmoil tearing her home apart, Anivia began to sense a greater threat: {{ci|Lissandra|an ancient evil}} growing deep within the earth. To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt. Like blood in water, darkness crept into the Freljord. With her destiny so tied to the power of the land, Anivia knew if such evil took root in her home, that same darkness would find its way into {{csl|Anivia|Blackfrost|her heart}}. She could no longer remain a mere guardian - the cryophoenix had to act.\n\nAnivia soon discovered an ally in {{ci|Ashe}}, the Frost Archer.

Now, with war on the horizon, Anivia prepares to fight for peace, but she knows the inevitable truth of her destiny.

One of [[Bilgewater]]'s most infamous bounty hunters, she built her legend upon a swathe of bullet-riddled corpses and captured ne'er-do-wells. The booming echoes of {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|her twin pistols}} in the port city's reeking wharfs and scavenger shanties are sure signs of another warrant from the Bounty Board being settled.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A2P3.png|left|150px]]\n\nLike most who rise to notoriety in the twisting, salt-encrusted labyrinth of Bilgewater, Miss Fortune has no shortage of blood on her hands. Yet, it was not always this way, for she was once known as Sarah, the beloved daughter of a renowned gun-dame who lived peacefully at her isolated island workshop. Young Sarah helped her mother in the forge, filing wheel locks, calibrating trigger pulls, or casting custom pistol shot. Her mother's skill in crafting firearms was legendary, and her bespoke handguns were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy noble. But ofttimes, they were desired by those with more meager means and darker hearts.\n\nOne who desired such a weapon was an up-and-coming reaver of Bilgewater called {{ci|Gangplank}}. Cocksure and certain of his power, he demanded Sarah's mother fashion {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|a pair of pistols}} the likes of which no other man possessed. A reluctant deal was struck, and a year later to the day, Gangplank returned for his weapons. He had donned a red scarf face-mask and had no intention of paying for the guns - he was there to take them by force.\n\nThe pistols Sarah's mother had crafted were masterpieces, twin hand cannons of pinpoint lethality and exquisite beauty. Too fine for the likes of him, declared Sarah's mother, seeing the brutish pirate that Gangplank had become. Enraged, Gangplank seized the pistols and gunned her down with her own creations before turning them on her husband and Sarah herself. Then, for spite's sake, he set the workshop ablaze and smashed both pistols on the ground, declaring that if they were too good for the likes of him, then no one would have them.\n\nSarah awoke to agony, straw-colored hair stained red with her mother's blood and bullets lodged on either side of her heart. She crawled from the burning ruins of her home with the broken remains of the two pistols clutched to her bleeding chest. Her body healed, but a part of her mind remained trapped in her mother's burning workshop, and no amount of soap could wash the vivid red from Sarah's hair \u2013 or at least, so the story is told. Waking nightmares and night terrors would forever torment her, but Sarah endured them with an all-consuming obsession with vengeance. She rebuilt her mother's pistols and learned all she could of the red-masked reaver during his rise to power, preparing for the day when she would be ready to slay him.\n\nTaking ship to Bilgewater, Sarah killed her first man within minutes of setting foot on the crooked timbers of the quayside, a drunken pirate with a gallon of Myron's Dark in his gut and a bounty on his head. Sarah shot him in his stupor and dragged his corpse to the Bounty Board, before tearing off a dozen more warrants.\n\nWithin a week, every one of them was settled, and those criminals who'd had the misfortune to be hunted by Sarah were either dead or in chains. She quickly earned a fearsome reputation in the taverns and gambling dens of Bilgewater, becoming Miss Fortune to inspire fear in those she hunted and to mask her true intent with flamboyant exploits. Gangplank would never see her coming; she would be just another bounty hunter among many in the crowded streets of Bilgewater.\n\nIn the years that followed, tales of Miss Fortune spread far and wide, each more fanciful than the last. She captured the ''Syren'' from a captain who learned the hard way what it meant to slip a hand where it wasn't wanted, drowned the master of the Silk-Knife Corsairs in a barrel of her own rum, and dragged the insane Doxy-Ripper from his lair in the belly of a half-dismembered leviathan in the slaughter docks.\n\n&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;400&quot; position=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\nMiss Fortune lore 01.jpg|Craftsmanship\nMiss Fortune lore 02.jpg|Weaponmaster\nMiss Fortune lore 03.jpg|Connection\nMiss Fortune lore 04.jpg|Confidence\nMiss Fortune lore 05.jpg|The Past\nMiss Fortune lore 06.jpg|Helplessness\nMiss Fortune lore 07.jpg|Devastation\nMiss Fortune lore 08.jpg|Unforgettable\nMiss Fortune lore 09.jpg|Death\nMiss Fortune lore 10.jpg|Life\nMiss Fortune lore 11.jpg|Lost\nMiss Fortune lore 12.jpg|Found\nMiss Fortune lore 13.jpg|Evolution\nMiss Fortune lore 14.jpg|Wreckless\nMiss Fortune lore 15.jpg|Delibrate\nMiss Fortune lore 16.jpg|Transportation\nMiss Fortune lore 17.jpg|Legend\nMiss Fortune lore 18.jpg|Imperfection\nMiss Fortune lore 19.jpg|Insanity\nMiss Fortune lore 20.jpg|Hunter\nMiss Fortune lore 21.jpg|Hunted\nMiss Fortune lore 22.jpg|Fury\nMiss Fortune lore 23.jpg|Fear\nMiss Fortune lore 24.jpg|Destruction\nMiss Fortune lore 25.jpg|Doubt\nMiss Fortune lore 26.jpg|Despair\nMiss Fortune lore 27.jpg|Refuge\nMiss Fortune lore 28.jpg|Reborn\nMiss Fortune lore 29.jpg|Confidence\nMiss Fortune lore 30.jpg|Everything\nMiss Fortune lore 31.jpg|The Target\nMiss Fortune lore 32.jpg|The Weapon\nMiss Fortune lore 34.jpg|The Duel\nMiss Fortune Captain Login Screen still.png|The Captain\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\nGangplank was still too powerful to confront openly, so Miss Fortune spent the years wisely, surrounding herself with a small but loyal cadre of allies and lovers she would eventually use to lay her demons to rest. But just killing Gangplank would never be enough for Miss Fortune. Only his abject humiliation and the burning to ash of all he cared for would satisfy the bloody-haired bounty hunter.\n\nAnd that day has come at last.\n\nMiss Fortune has risked everything to make her opening move against Gangplank. Plots within plots have seen the ''Dead Pool'' blown to flaming wreckage at the quayside and the self-professed King of Bilgewater overthrown. Best of all, everyone in Bilgewater saw him fall.\n\nNow, with Gangplank deposed, every reaver captain and ganglord in the port city is vying to take his position.\n\nThe battle for Bilgewater has begun.\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A2P3.png|left|150px]]\n\n[[Bilgewater]]'s White Wharf had earned its name thanks to the layer of bird waste covering it from end to end, which was only to be expected at a resting place for the dead. Folk here didn't bury corpses; they returned them to the sea. A grave of the sunken dead hung suspended in the cold depths, marked by hundreds of bobbing grave-buoys. Some were merely name posts, while others were elaborate tomb markers carved to resemble rearing krakens or buxom sea wenches.\n\n{{ci|Miss Fortune}} sat on an empty crate of Rapture Rum at the end of the wharf, legs crossed and a noxious cheroot dangling from her bottom lip. In one hand, she held a length of breathing tube connected to a half-submerged coffin floating low in the water. In the other, she grasped a length of frayed rope running through a rusted pulley block and tied to the coffin lid. {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|Both her pistols}} were holstered within easy reach.\n\nMoonlight cast a weak glow through the mist rolling in from the sea, staining the water's scummed surface tobacco yellow. Cawing carrion gulls lined every swaybacked roof on the quayside, which was always a good omen. They knew better than any the signs of fresh pickings.\n\n''&quot;About time&quot;'', she whispered, as a shaven-headed man in a drake-scale frock coat emerged from the narrow, debris-choked alley. A pack of needle-toothed wharf-rats stalked him, hoping he was drunk and might pass out to become easy meat. The man's name was Jakmunt Zyglos, one of the Painted Brothers. Any corsair worth his salt had tattoos, but every inch of Zyglos was inked with clawed serpents, lovers' names, and a record of every boat he'd sunk, every man he'd murdered. His skin was as good a confession as any she'd known.\n\nHe marched purposefully along the wharf, but his eyes darting warily from side to side gave the lie to his confidence. His hand gripped a long cutlass with a shark-toothed edge that hung low on his hip. He too boasted a firearm, a stubby carbine with glassy pipes running the length of its barrel.\n\n''&quot;Where is he?&quot;'' demanded Zyglos. ''&quot;You said you'd bring him.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That a [[Piltover]] hex-carbine?&quot;'' she asked, ignoring his question.\n\n''&quot;Answer me, damn you!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You first&quot;'', said Miss Fortune, letting some rope out through the pulley and allowing the coffin to sink a little more. ''&quot;After all, I'm not sure how long this breathing tube is, and you wouldn't want your brother to go without air, would you?&quot;''\n\nZyglos took a breath, and she saw the tension go out of him.\n\n''&quot;Yes, damn you, it's from Piltover&quot;'', he said, drawing the weapon and holding it out by the trigger guard.\n\n''&quot;Pricy&quot;'' said Miss Fortune.\n\n''&quot;I guess you\u2019d know&quot;'', he sneered.\n\nShe let out even more rope. Bubbles of air escaped the now fully submerged coffin. Zyglos held up his hands, instantly contrite.\n\n''&quot;Alright! Alright!&quot;'' he pleaded. ''&quot;It's yours. Pull him up. Please.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You'll come quietly?&quot;''\n\nZyglos gave a bark of fatalistic laughter.\n\n''&quot;What choice do I have?&quot;'' he asked. ''&quot;You sank my ships and killed all my men. You've sent my kin to the poorhouse or the gaol, and for what? A stolen hex-gun? A bounty?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A little of both and then some?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;So how much am I worth to you, bitch?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Coin? Five hundred {{ai|Silver Serpents|Gangplank}}.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;All this mayhem for a lousy five hundred serpents?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's not the money that's got you killed. It's the fact that you're one of {{ci|Gangplank}}'s sworn men&quot;'', said Miss Fortune. ''&quot;That's why I want you dead.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Dead? Wait, the warrant says alive!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;True, but I've never been very good at following instructions&quot;'', said Miss Fortune, releasing the rope and the breathing tube. The coffin plunged into the darkness of the sunken dead, trailing a froth of frantic bubbles. Zyglos screamed his brother's name and ran at her, drawing his serrated sword. She let him get within spitting distance before drawing her pistols and blasting him with both barrels, one through the eye, one in the heart.\n\nMiss Fortune spat her cheroot into the sea and blew the smoke from each muzzle.\n\n''&quot;Self defense&quot;'', she said with a smile, rehearsing her lie for the bounty pursers. ''&quot;Crazy fool came at me with that fang-sword of his. I didn't have a choice.&quot;''\n\nMiss Fortune bent to retrieve the fallen hex-carbine. She turned the weapon over in her hands. Too light for her tastes, but artfully made and absurdly lethal. The ghost of a smile twitched the corner of her mouth as she thought back to the warmth of the old workshop, the smell of gun oil, and the touch of her mother's hand on her shoulder. Miss Fortune sighed and shook off the memory before it turned sour. She threw the pistol out over the water, sending it down to the dead. The sea demanded its due, after all, and she'd not lied; the weapon was worth a small fortune.\n\nShe stood and strolled back into Bilgewater.

Trapped on the [[Shadow Isles]], his only companions are the {{ai|Shepherd of Souls|Yorick|rotting corpses}} and {{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|shrieking spirits}} that he gathers to him. Yorick's monstrous actions belie his noble purpose: to free his home from the curse of {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|the Ruination}}.\n\n==Lore==\nEven as a child, Yorick's life was never normal. Raised in a fishing village at the very edge of the Blessed Isles, he always struggled to find acceptance. While most children his age were playing hide-and-seek, young Yorick was making friends of a different kind - the spirits of the recently deceased.\n\nAt first, Yorick was terrified of his ability to see and hear the dead. Whenever someone in the village passed away, Yorick would lie awake all night, waiting for the chilling cry of a new visitor. He could not understand why they chose to haunt him, and why his parents believed the spirits to be nothing more than nightmares.\n\nIn time, he came to realize the souls were not there to harm him. They were simply lost and needed help finding their way to the beyond. Since only Yorick was able to see these spirits, he took it upon himself to be their guide, escorting them to whatever awaited in eternity.\n\nThe task was bittersweet. Yorick found that he enjoyed the company of ghosts, but each one he brought to rest meant saying farewell to another friend. To the dead, he was a savior, but to the living, he was a pariah. The villagers only saw a disturbed little boy who spoke to people who weren't there.\n\nTales of Yorick's visions soon spread beyond his village, and drew the attention of a small order of monks who dwelled at the heart of the Blessed Isles. Its envoys traveled to Yorick's island, believing he could become an asset to their faith.\n\nYorick agreed to journey to their monastery, and there, he learned the ways of the Brethren of the Dusk and the true significance of their trappings. Every monk carried a {{ai|Last Rites|Yorick|spade}} as a symbol of their duty to conduct proper burial rites, which ensured souls would not lose their way. And each brother wore a vial of water drawn from the Blessed Isles' sacred spring. These Tears of Life represented the monks' duty to heal the living.\n\nYet, no matter how he tried, Yorick could never gain the acceptance of the other monks. To them, he was tangible proof of things that should only be known through faith. They resented his power to easily perceive what they themselves had struggled their entire lives to understand. Shunned by his brothers, Yorick found himself alone again.\n\nOne morning, as he tended to his duties in the cemetery, Yorick was interrupted by the sight of a pitch-black cloud roiling across the surface of the Blessed Isles, devouring everything in its path. Yorick tried to run, but the cloud quickly enveloped him and plunged him into shadow.\n\nAll around Yorick, living things began to writhe and contort, corrupted by the foul magic in [[the Black Mist]]. People, animals, even plants began to transform into vile, ghoulish mockeries of their former selves. Whispers emanated from the turbulent air around him, and his brothers began ripping the vials of healing water from their necks, as if the objects were causing them great anguish. A moment later, Yorick watched in abject horror as the monks' souls were ripped from their bodies, leaving cold, pale corpses behind.\n\nAmong the quieting screams of his brethren, Yorick alone could hear voices within the mist.\n\n{{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|''&quot;Remove it. Join us. We will become one.&quot;''}}\n\nHe felt his fingers grasping for the vial at his neck. Mustering all his resolve, Yorick forced his hands away from his throat and commanded the howling souls to stop. The Black Mist writhed violently, and darkness overtook him.\n\nWhen Yorick awoke, the winds had calmed, and the once-fertile lands had transformed into the grotesque hellscape of the [[Shadow Isles]]. Isolated tendrils of the Black Mist clung to him, trying to overtake the one living thing not yet corrupted. As the Mist wrapped itself around him, Yorick saw it suddenly recoil from the vial at his neck. Yorick clutched the blessed water, realizing it was all that kept him alive.\n\nIn the days that followed, Yorick scoured the islands for survivors, but found only the twisted remnants of what once lived there. Everywhere he walked, he witnessed wretched spirits rising from the bodies of the dead.\n\nAs he searched, Yorick slowly pieced together the events that led to the cataclysm: a king had arrived seeking to resurrect his queen, but instead, had doomed the Isles and everything on them.\n\nYorick wished to find this {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|'Ruined King'}} and undo the curse he had unleashed. But he felt powerless in the face of the seemingly endless death that surrounded him.\n\nAlmost lost within his grief, Yorick began to speak to the spirits around him, attempting to find solace with them as he had as a child. Instead, as he communed with the Mist, {{ai|Shepherd of Souls|Yorick|corpses}} left their {{ai|Awakening|Yorick|graves}}, guided by his voice. He realized the bodies he once laid to rest were now his to command.\n\nA glimmer of hope shone from the heart of his despair. To free the dead of the Shadow Isles, Yorick would wield their power and their strength.\n\nIn order to end the curse, he would be forced to use it.\n\n;Last Rites\n''&quot;Help... me&quot;'', begged the shipwrecked man.\n\n{{ci|Yorick}} couldn't say how long the survivor had been lying there, bones broken, bleeding into what remained of his wrecked sailing vessel. He had been moaning loudly, but his cries were drowned out by the multitude of wailing souls that haunted the isle. A maelstrom of spirits gathered around him, drawn to his flickering life force like a beacon, hungry to reap a fresh soul. The man's eyes widened in horror.\n\nHe was right to be scared. Yorick had seen what happened to lost spirits taken by the Black Mist, and this - this was warm flesh, a rarity in the [[Shadow Isles]]. It had been how long - a hundred years? - since Yorick had seen a living being? He could feel the Mist on his back quivering, eager to wrap this stranger in its cold embrace. But the sight of the man stirred something in Yorick he had long forgotten, and whatever it was would not allow him to surrender this life. The burly monk heaved the damaged man onto his shoulders and carried him back up the hill to his old monastery.\n\nYorick studied the face of the injured man as he groaned in agonized protest with each step the monk took. ''Why did you come here, live one?''\n\nAfter completing the climb, Yorick carried his guest through several corridors in the abbey, before coming to a stop in an old infirmary. He eased the shipwrecked man onto a massive stone table and began to check his vitals. Most of the man's ribs were shattered, and one of his lungs had collapsed.\n\n{{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|''&quot;Why do you waste your time?&quot;''}} asked a chorus of voices, speaking in unison from the Mist on Yorick's back.\n\nYorick remained silent. He left the table and made his way to a heavy door in the rear of the infirmary. The door resisted as he pushed, his hand doing little but leaving a print in the thick layer of dust. He pressed his shoulder against the wood and heaved his entire weight into it.\n\n''&quot;So much effort for naught&quot;'', sneered the Mist. ''&quot;Let us have him.&quot;''\n\nAgain, Yorick answered it with contemptuous silence as he finally forced the door open. The heavy oak dragged across the stone tiles of the monastery floor, revealing a chamber full of scrolls, herbs, and poultices. For a moment, Yorick stared at the artifacts of his former life, struggling to remember how to use them. He picked up a few that looked familiar - bandages, yellow and brittle with age, and some ointment that had long turned to crust\u2014and returned to the man atop the stone table.\n\n''&quot;Just leave him&quot;'', said the Mist. ''&quot;He was ours the moment he came ashore.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Quiet!&quot;'' snapped Yorick.\n\nThe man on the table was now gasping for breath. Knowing he had little time to save him, Yorick tried to bind his wounds, but the rotten bandages fell apart as quickly as he could apply them.\n\nAs his breath grew more ragged, the man convulsed. He grabbed the monk's arm in agonized desperation. Yorick knew there was only one thing that could save the man's life. He uncorked the crystal vial at his neck, and considered the life-giving water it contained. There was precious little left. Yorick was unsure if it was enough to save the man, and even if it did...\n\nYorick was forced to face the truth. In trying to save the man, he was just chasing the memory of his former life, when this cursed place was called the Blessed Isles. The souls in the Mist had taunted him, but they'd taunted him with the truth. This man was doomed, and if Yorick used the Tears of Life, he would be too. He closed the vial and let it rest against his neck.\n\nStepping back from the table, Yorick watched the man's chest rise and fall one last time. [[The Black Mist]] filled the room, spirits clawing out from it in anticipation. The Mist shivered eagerly, then ripped the dead man's soul from his body. It uttered a faint, feeble cry before it was devoured by its new host.\n\nYorick stood motionless in the room and uttered a barely remembered prayer. He looked at the soulless husk on the table, a bitter reminder of the task he had yet to complete. While the curse of the Ruination remained, anyone who came to these isles would suffer the same fate. He had to bring peace to these cursed islands, but after years of searching, all he had found were whispers about {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|a ruined king}}.\n\nHe needed answers.\n\nWith a single motion of Yorick's hand, {{ai|Mourning Mist|Yorick|a thin strand of Mist}} poured into the man's body. A moment later, it rose from the table, barely sentient. But it could see, it could hear, and it could walk.\n\n''&quot;Help me&quot;'', said Yorick.\n\nThe body shambled out the door of the infirmary, its sloughing footsteps echoing through the halls of the monastery. It continued out into the foul air of the cemetery, walking through the rows of {{ai|Awakening|Yorick|emptied graves}}.\n\nYorick watched as the corpse trudged toward the center of the isles until it disappeared into the Mist. Perhaps this one would return with the answer.\n\n", "id": 83}, "Xerath": {"key": "Xerath", "name": "Xerath", "title": "the Magus Ascendant", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Xerath\n|real_name  = * Xerath &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Shurima|Shuriman:]] &quot;one who shares&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;\n|alias      = * The Magus Ascendant \n* Emperor Xerath\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|weapon_pet = *{{ai|Shocking Orb|Xerath|Pure Arcane energy}}\n|race       = [[Ascendant]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Corrupted Arcane form, formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Shurima|Shuriman Capital]], [[Shurima]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Ancient times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence  = [[Shurima|Nerimazeth]], [[Shurima]]\n|faction    = * Independent\n|friends    = Renekton, Cassiopeia\n|rivals     = \n|enemies    = Azir, Nasus\n|related    = \n*[[Azir/Background|Azir - Arisen]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKnM6Hh5gOg/ Shurima: Descent into the Tomb]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima Ascension]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast army]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/xerath Magus Ascendant]\n* [[Bloodline]]\n|render = [[File:Xerath Render.png|link=|270px]]}}\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;A lifetime as a slave has prepared me for eternity as your master.&quot;'' - {{ci|Xerath}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n", "background": "{ci|Xerath}} is an [[Ascendant|Ascended]] Magus of ancient [[Shurima]], a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|magical sarcophagus}}. For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nThe boy who would eventually be called Xerath was born a nameless slave in Shurima thousands of years ago. He was the son of captured scholars, with only the prospect of endless servitude ahead. His mother taught him letters and numbers, while his father told him tales from history in the hopes that such skills might allow him a better life. The boy vowed he would not end up bent-backed and whipped like every other slave.\n\nWhen the boy\u2019s father was crippled during the excavations for the foundations of a monument to the Emperor\u2019s favorite horse, he was left to die at the site of the accident. Fearing her son would suffer a similar fate, the boy\u2019s mother begged an esteemed tomb architect to take him on as an apprentice. Though at first reluctant, the architect was impressed with the boy\u2019s eye for detail and innate understanding of mathematics and language, and accepted. The boy never saw his mother again.\n\nHe was a swift learner and his master dispatched him on errands to the Great Library of {{ci|Nasus}} to retrieve specific texts and plans on an almost daily basis. On one trip, the boy met {{ci|Azir}}, the least-favored son of the emperor. Azir was struggling to read a difficult passage in an ancient text, and, despite knowing that to talk to royalty was to invite death, the boy paused to help the young prince with its complex grammar. In that moment, a tentative friendship was established, and over the coming months that friendship only grew stronger.\n\nThough slaves were forbidden names, Azir gave one to the boy. He named him Xerath, which means \u2018one who shares,\u2019 though that name was only ever spoken between the two boys. Azir saw to it that Xerath was appointed to his household\u2019s slaves, and made him his personal attendant. Their shared love of knowledge saw them devour texts from the library and become as close as brothers. Xerath was Azir\u2019s constant companion, learning all he could from this new proximity to culture, power and knowledge, finally daring to dream that Azir might one day free him.\n\nOn the annual tour of the emperor\u2019s dominion, assassins struck the royal caravan as it spent the night at a well-known oasis. Xerath saved Azir from an assassin\u2019s blade, but Azir\u2019s brothers were all slain, leaving the young prince a heartbeat away from Shurima\u2019s throne. As a slave, Xerath could expect no reward for his deed, but Azir promised that one day they would be as brothers.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination attempt, Shurima endured years of horror and fear of the emperor\u2019s retribution. Xerath knew enough of history and the workings of the Shuriman court to understand that Azir\u2019s life hung by the slenderest of threads. That he was heir to the throne meant nothing, for the emperor hated Azir for living while his more beloved sons had died. Of more immediate danger, the emperor\u2019s wife was still young enough to bear other children, and thus far she had borne many healthy sons. The odds were good that she would produce another male heir for her husband, and as soon as she did, Azir\u2019s life was forfeit.\n\nThough Azir was a scholar at heart, Xerath persuaded him that to survive, he must also learn to fight. This Azir did, and in return the young heir elevated Xerath, insisting he continue his education. Both youths excelled, and Xerath proved to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, one who took to the pursuit of knowledge with gusto. Xerath became Azir\u2019s confidant and right-hand man, a position unheard of for a mere slave. This position gave him great - and some said, undue - influence over the young prince, who came to rely on Xerath\u2019s judgement more each day.\n\nXerath bent his every effort into seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it, no matter the cost, no matter its source. He unlocked long-sealed libraries, delved into forgotten vaults and consulted with mystics entombed deep beneath the sands; all to further his knowledge and ambition, both of which grew with unchecked rapidity. Whenever the whispers around court that spoke of his delving into unsavory places grew too loud to ignore, he would find cunning means to silence them. That Azir never mentioned these whispers was, to Xerath, tacit approval of how he was keeping his emperor safe.\n\nYears passed, and Xerath took ever darker steps to keep the emperor\u2019s wife from carrying a child to term, using his nascent magical abilities to corrupt every infant in the womb. Without rivals to the throne, Azir would be safe. When rumors of a curse arose, Xerath ensured they were never spoken again, and ofttimes those who had voiced such suspicions vanished without trace. By now, Xerath\u2019s desire to escape his roots as a slave had become a burning ambition to achieve power of his own, though he justified every murderous act by telling himself he was doing it to keep his friend alive.\n\nDespite Xerath\u2019s best efforts to thwart the queen\u2019s midwives, a new prince of Shurima was brought into the world, but on the night of his birth, Xerath used his growing magical powers to summon the elemental spirits of the deep desert and craft a terrible storm. Xerath brought bolt after bolt of lightning down upon the queen\u2019s chambers, reducing it to burning rubble and killing the queen and her newborn son. The emperor rushed to his queen\u2019s chambers, only to be confronted by Xerath, his hands ablaze with arcane power. The emperor\u2019s guards attacked, but Xerath burned them and the emperor to cindered skeletons. Xerath ensured that the mages of a conquered territory were blamed for these deaths, and Azir\u2019s first act upon taking the throne was to lead a brutal campaign of retribution against its people.\n\nAzir was crowned emperor of Shurima with Xerath at his side, the boy who had once been a nameless slave. Xerath had long dreamed of this moment, and expected Azir to end slavery in Shurima before finally naming him brother. Azir did none of these things, continuing to expand his empire\u2019s borders and deflecting Xerath\u2019s overtures regarding the end of slavery. To Xerath, this was further proof of Shurima\u2019s moral bankruptcy, and he raged at Azir\u2019s breaking of his promise. Azir\u2019s face was thunderous as he reminded Xerath that he was a slave and should remember his place. Something once noble died in Xerath that day, but he bowed in supplication, outwardly accepting Azir\u2019s decision. As Azir continued his campaigns of conquest, Xerath remained at his side, but his every action was carefully designed to increase his influence over a realm he now planned to take for himself. To steal an empire was no small thing, and Xerath knew he needed more power.\n\nThe famous legend of Renekton\u2019s Ascension revealed that a mortal did not have to be chosen by the Sun Priests, that anyone could rise up. So Xerath plotted to steal the power of Ascension. No slave could ever stand upon the sun disc, so Xerath fed the Emperor\u2019s vanity, inflating his ego and filling his head with impossible visions of a world-spanning empire. But such a dream would only be possible if Azir could Ascend as the greatest heroes of Shurima had before. In time Xerath\u2019s perseverance paid off, and Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that he had earned the right to stand alongside Nasus and Renekton as an Ascended being. The Sun Priests protested, but such was Azir\u2019s hubris that he ordered them to comply on pain of torture and death.\n\nThe Day of Ascension arrived and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension with Xerath at his side. Nasus and Renekton were absent from the day\u2019s events, for Xerath had arranged a distraction for them by weakening the seal on a magical sarcophagus containing {{ci|Brand|a beast of living fire}}. When that creature finally broke its bindings, Renekton and Nasus were the only warriors capable of defeating it. Thus Xerath had stripped Azir of the only two beings who might save him from what was to come.\n\nAzir stood beneath the sun disc and in the final moment before the priests began the ritual, events took a turn Xerath had not anticipated. The emperor turned to Xerath and told him that he was now a free man. He and all Shurima\u2019s slaves were now released from their bonds of servitude. He embraced Xerath before naming him his eternal brother. Xerath was stunned. He had been given everything he desired, but the success of his plans hinged upon Azir\u2019s death and nothing was going to dissuade him from acting. Too many pieces were in motion and Xerath had already sacrificed too much to turn back now \u2013 no matter how much that part of him wanted to. The emperor\u2019s words pierced the bitterness enclosing Xerath\u2019s heart, but came decades too late. Unaware of his peril, Azir turned as the priests began the ritual and brought down the awesome power of the sun.\n\nWith a roar of anger and grief combined, Xerath blasted Azir from his place on the dais, watching through tears as his former friend burned to ash. Xerath took Azir\u2019s place and the light of the sun filled him, reshaping his flesh into that of an Ascended being. But the power of the ritual was not his to take, and the consequences of his betrayal of Azir were devastating. The unbound power of the sun all but destroyed Shurima, sundering its temples and bringing ruination upon the city. Azir\u2019s people were consumed in a terrifying conflagration as the desert rose up to claim the city. The sun disc fell and an empire built by generations of emperors was undone in a single day.\n\nEven as the city burned, Xerath held the sun priests in the grip of his magic, preventing them from ending the ritual. The energies filling him were immense, alloying with his dark sorcery to create a being of incredible power. As he drew ever more of the sun\u2019s power into his body, his mortal flesh was consumed and remade as a glowing vortex of arcane power.\n\nWith Xerath\u2019s treachery revealed, {{ci|Renekton}} and {{ci|Nasus}} rushed to the epicenter of the magical storm destroying the city. They bore with them the magical sarcophagus that had imprisoned the spirit of eternal fire. The Ascended brothers fought their way to the Dais of Ascension just as Xerath fell from the deadly radiance engulfing the city. Before the newly-Ascended Magus could react, they hurled his crackling body within the sarcophagus and sealed it once more with blessed chains and powerful sigils of binding.\n\nBut it was not enough. Xerath\u2019s power had been great as a mortal, and that power - combined with the gift of Ascension - made him all but invincible. He shattered the sarcophagus, though its shards and chains remained bound to him. Renekton and Nasus hurled themselves at Xerath, but such was his newfound strength that he fought them both to a standstill. The battle raged throughout the collapsing city, destroying what had not already sunk beneath the sands. The brothers were able to drag Xerath toward the Tomb of Emperors, the greatest mausoleum of Shurima, a vault whose locks and wards were impossible to break and which answered only to the blood of emperors. Renekton wrestled Xerath within and called upon Nasus to seal the vault behind them. Nasus did so with heavy heart, knowing it was the only way to prevent Xerath\u2019s escape. Renekton and Xerath fell into eternal darkness, and there they remained, locked in an endless battle as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed.\n\nUncounted centuries passed and, in time, even Renekton\u2019s mighty strength waned, leaving him vulnerable to Xerath\u2019s influence. With poisoned lies and illusions, Xerath twisted Renekton\u2019s mind, filling him with misplaced bitterness toward Nasus, the faithless brother who had - in Xerath\u2019s fictive narrative - abandoned him so long ago.\n\nWhen the Tomb of Emperors was finally discovered beneath the desert and broken open by Sivir and Cassiopeia, both Xerath and Renekton were freed in an explosion of sand and rubble. Sensing his brother still lived, Renekton charged from the ruins, his distorted mind leaving him little better than a savage beast. After an age lost to legend, Shurima was reborn, and as it rose majestically from the desert, Xerath felt another soul return to life beneath the sand, one he had thought long dead. Azir was also newly resurrected as one of the Ascended, and Xerath knew there could be no peace for either of them while the other yet lived.\n\nXerath sought the heart of the desert to regain his strength and understand how the world had changed in the millennia since his imprisonment. His stolen power grew with every passing moment, and he beheld a world ripe for conquest, a world brimming with mortals ready to worship at the feet of a new and terrible god.\n\nYet for all his newfound power, however far he has come from that nameless slave boy, a part of Xerath knows he is still in chains.\n\n", "id": 101}, "Sivir": {"key": "Sivir", "name": "Sivir", "title": "the Battle Mistress", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Sivir\n|alias  = The Battle Mistress\n|render = Sivir Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|The Chalicar}}\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Shurima]]\n|residence = Shuriman Capital, [[Shurima]]\n|occupation = \n* Mercenary\n* Heiress of [[Shurima]]\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shurima Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shurima]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Azir, Nasus, Taliyah\n|enemies = Cassiopeia, Xerath\n|related = \n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima] \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKnM6Hh5gOg/ Descent into the Tomb]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYyuH1Bp2ZI/ Rise of the Ascended]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/sivir Battle Mistress]\n* [[Bloodline]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;I don't care what face is on your coin, as long as it pays.&quot;'' - {{ci|Sivir}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSivir is a renowned fortune hunter and mercenary captain who plies her trade in the deserts of [[Shurima]]. Armed with {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|her legendary jeweled crossblade}}, she has fought and won countless battles for those who can afford her exorbitant price. Known for her fearless resolve and endless ambition, she prides herself on recovering buried treasures from the perilous tombs of Shurima - for a generous bounty. With {{ci|Azir|ancient}} {{ci|Xerath|forces}} stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir finds herself torn between conflicting destinies.\n\n==Lore==\nSivir learned firsthand the harsh lessons of desert life when her entire family was killed by marauding Kthaons, one of Shurima's most feared raider tribes. In the weeks and months after the massacre, she survived by stealing food from local markets and exploring deserted ruins in search of trinkets to sell.\n\nMost of the ruins had long since been picked clean by thieves, but Sivir excelled at unearthing treasures others had missed. With her keen eye and relentless determination, she exposed secret passageways, solved ancient puzzles to reveal hidden catacombs, and dodged perilous traps.\n\nOccasionally, she persuaded other children to help her plunder tombs that would be impossible to loot alone. Armed with no more than coils of rope and candles, the malnourished waifs would descend into the cramped tunnels beneath the ruins in search of anything worth selling.\n\nOne day, Sivir and her compatriots ventured deep into a secret tomb she swore was filled with riches beyond imagining. After many hours of exploration, they finally discovered a hidden doorway, but were crushed to find nothing more than an empty chamber. Enraged at their wasted effort, Mhyra, Sivir's oldest companion, demanded she forfeit her role as leader. Sivir refused, and a vicious fight ensued. Mhyra was larger and stronger, and quickly overpowered Sivir before pushing her off a ledge. Hours later, Sivir awoke alone in the dark. Fighting back panic, she retraced her steps, blind and feeling her way slowly back to daylight. Once she returned to her lair, she found her traitorous friend had fled, taking everything Sivir owned with her.\n\nSivir swore she would never allow herself to be betrayed again. Determined to learn to defend herself, she joined a band of sellswords led by the legendary Iha Ziharo, serving as a weapon carrier, navigator, and dogsbody for the belligerent mercenaries.\n\nFor years, Sivir slept with a dagger tucked under her blanket. She placed no trust in Ziharo's warriors, knowing their only loyalty was to coin, but she strived to learn all she could. Sivir trained to fight, practicing with staunch determination and sparring against the younger sellswords daily.\n\nSivir's unwavering dedication and swift-growing skill caught the eye of Iha Ziharo herself, who took Sivir under her wing - an honor few received. Over the years, Sivir became a formidable warrior, and as Iha's sergeant, she fought against numerous armies, raiders and warring tribes. When the wars ended and the mercenaries struggled to find paying work, Sivir led expeditions into the ruins in search of Shurima's lost treasures.\n\nEventually, Sivir tired of living in Ziharo's shadow. The domineering leader took the greatest share of the gold, and all the glory - though it was Sivir's knowledge of Shuriman tombs that brought them much of their wealth. Worse, Ziharo refused to fight for warlords whose reputations for cruelty were at odds with her martial code of honor. But to Sivir, gold was gold, no matter how bloody the hands that paid it - morals played no part in the transaction.\n\nMany of the mercenaries agreed with Sivir and plotted with her to replace Ziharo as leader. The night before their coup, Ziharo learned of the plan. Outraged, she struck first, planning to turn her blade on her former student as she slept. Sivir had expected such an attack, and defeated Ziharo in a vicious knife brawl. Nevertheless, she was surprised to find she couldn't kill her former mentor, remembering how Ziharo had taken her in when she was no more than a bitter girl with nothing to her name. Instead, she left Ziharo alone in the desert with a half-filled waterskin, a single coin and a hollow offer of good luck.\n\nSivir's warband quickly earned a fearsome reputation as warriors of renown and explorers who could find relics that had passed into legend. Desert barons, wealthy merchants and collectors of the arcane commissioned Sivir to fight their wars or recover rare, hidden treasures. Explorers willingly paid Sivir's high price for her skill in traversing dangerous territories and navigating the ancient ruins of Shurima. Ruling chieftains hired her company to defend their lands against raiding [[Noxus|Noxians]], while warlords procured their services early in their campaigns to ensure a swift victory.\n\nIn the Year of a Thousand Storms, the lord of an ancient Shuriman city known as Nashramae hired Sivir to seek {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|a unique cross-shaped blade}} he claimed was a lost heirloom. He sent his personal guards along with her to guarantee its retrieval, and after a search that lasted many months, Sivir finally located the weapon. She pried it from the sarcophagus of a long-forgotten hero buried beneath tons of collapsed rubble with a strange sense that her entire life had been leading up to this moment. The weapon shone with gold and emeralds, and though it was ancient, its edge was as sharp as if it had been forged that day.\n\nSivir was transfixed by the crossblade, feeling as if it had been waiting for her. When the captain of the Nashramae guard demanded they return to their lord with his prize, Sivir knew she could never give it up. Sivir threw the crossblade in a curved arc, and marveled as it decapitated not only the captain, but the three men behind him before returning to her hand. Never had a weapon felt so natural in her grip, so powerful to throw. She fought her way from the tomb to emerge triumphant with the Lord of Nashramae's men dead behind her.\n\nTales of Sivir's exploits and ferocity in battle were already well-known within Shurima, but as her legend grew, her reputation spread beyond even the desert lands. In Noxus, stories of her deeds reached the ears of {{ci|Cassiopeia}}, an ambitious noblewoman who desired a relic she believed was hidden in the heart of the desert. Cassiopeia had no shortage of coin, and hired Sivir as her guide to plunder the depths of the long lost capital of Shurima.\n\nThough she instinctively distrusted Cassiopeia, Sivir was not about to dismiss such a profitable expedition. As they plunged deeper into the twisting catacombs of the buried city, many of Sivir's mercenaries were killed by a slew of deadly traps, but Cassiopeia refused to turn back. After days of endless descent into darkness, Sivir and Cassiopeia finally reached a great bas-relief depicting ancient emperors and [[Ascended]] warriors with bestial heads. Most of the buried structures they had seen were shattered from millennia spent beneath the sands, but this wall was uncannily intact. Sivir felt her blood stir as she gazed at the carvings, mesmerized by a creeping sense of recognition. In that moment of inattention, her fate was sealed.\n\nTaking advantage of Sivir's distraction, Cassiopeia stepped in close and rammed a blade through her back. Sivir collapsed in agony, her lifeblood soaking into the sand. Cassiopeia pried Sivir's crossblade from her grasp as her senses dimmed like a guttering candle. As warmth faded from her body, death closed in.\n\nBut fate was not yet done with Sivir. As her lifeblood drained, her ancestor, the long-dead emperor {{ci|Azir}}, was resurrected by the echoes of royalty within her blood. He carried her body to the Oasis of the Dawn, a sacred pool once brimming with healing waters. Bone-dry for thousands of years, it now overflowed with crystal water at Azir's presence. The healing waters enveloped Sivir's body, miraculously undoing the fatal wound dealt to her by Cassiopeia.\n\nWith a labored gasp, Sivir opened her eyes, dazed and uncomprehending, as if dragged from a dream. A vaguely familiar face looked down at her with kindness, and Sivir blinked, unsure if she was alive or dead. All around her, spirals of dust whirled hundreds of feet in the air forming towering palaces, ornate temples, and expansive plazas. The ancient city of Shurima rose from its sandy grave in all its glory and splendor, crowned by {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|an enormous golden disc}} shining brighter than the noonday sun. With Azir's return, the ancient city was restored to its former majesty.\n\nSivir had grown up hearing tales of the legendary Ascended, but thought only children and fools believed in such fantasy. Surrounded by a city that, stone by stone, restored itself from nothing, and confronted by a long-dead Emperor who spoke of his enduring bloodline and vision of a reborn kingdom, Sivir was shaken to her core. Everything she had ever believed in was cast into doubt.\n\nWith his words still ringing in her ears, she retreated to her life as a mercenary, taking solace in the everyday realities of fighting for coin. She struggled to accept she might be the heir to a forgotten empire, and tried to put such thoughts out of her mind. Even if everything Azir said were true, she was sure no one could unite the disparate tribes of Shurima. The most powerful warlords could command small territories for a time with enough gold and warriors, but the land would never rally beneath a single banner, let alone bow to one man - even if he truly was an ancient emperor.\n\nAs Azir strives to reestablish his once-mighty empire, Sivir is tormented by increasing doubts as to whether she can fully return to her former life. Looming forces encroach upon her world, and for better or worse, fate has given her a second chance at life.\n\nNow she must choose her path, and forge a new legacy.\n\n;Water\nSivir's throat felt like it was coated in a layer of broken glass. The cracked flesh of her lips burned. Her eyes refused to focus. ''I've given them more than enough time to move on.''\n\nShe leaned around the edge of the boulder. The caravan was still at the spring and showing no signs of moving on.\n\n''Why did they have to be Kthaons?'' Of the many, many tribes that want her dead, the Kthaons stood out in their persistence.\n\nSivir scanned the tribesmen again, looking for any sign the caravan might climb out of the old riverbed and continue its journey. She rolled her shoulders trying to judge if her muscles were up to fighting a half-dozen men. She'd have to take them by surprise to stand a chance.\n\n''{{ci|Cassiopeia|That prissy Noxian}} got the drop on me...''\n\nSivir shook her head, trying to clear her mind. Now wasn't the time for those thoughts. ''I'm becoming scattered from the lack of water. Why didn't I bring more water?''\n\nThe city had been bursting with it. Huge streams poured from statues, all at the command of {{ci|Azir|an Ancient}}. ''He healed my wound and saved my life.'' Then he returned to rebuilding the temples around him, calling out strange words in an old dialect she could barely make sense of. Talking to himself in a dead city filled only with sand. ''I had to get out before that sorcerer decided to sink it all back beneath the dust - or that I owed him.''\n\nSwallowing brought fresh agony to Sivir's throat. She looked at the spring again, a simple puddle of brown water in the center of the caravan.\n\n''I've given them a day'', she reasoned. ''I will die, or they will die. For a few drops of water or a few slivers of gold. That is the way of the desert.''\n\n{{ai|Fleet of Foot|Sivir|Sprinting toward}} the first guard, she readied {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|her crossblade}}. ''Would there be enough time to reach him before he turned back around?'' She counted the distance. ''Fourteen strides. Twelve. Ten. He can't make a sound. Two strides.'' She jumped. Her blade sank completely through his neck, down into his shoulder.\n\nBlood erupted as she crashed down on him. Her momentum drove them behind the line of rocks on which he'd been standing. Sivir grabbed his arms. He struggled against her, refusing to accept he was already dead. The guard's blood drenched Sivir as he took a final gurgling breath. ''This man didn't need to die.''\n\nSivir thought again of {{ci|Cassiopeia}}'s blade. ''That [[Noxus|Noxian]] bitch sunk a blade in my back. I died. That should mean something.''\n\nA distant rumble sounded. ''Horses? A sandwall collapsing?'' There wasn't time to wonder what it meant. Sivir crawled across the hard stones. ''It won't take the rest of the caravan long to notice the guard's absence.'' The next target was moving high along the ridge line. She needed to hit him before he walked away from the ledge. ''The shot has to be perfect.'' She threw the crossblade.\n\nIt hit the second guard, cutting him in half. The flying blade arced upward, but as it reached its apex, it slowed before reversing its direction. As it flew back toward her, it clipped the neck of the third man. There wouldn't be time for another throw now - the blade completed its arc, flying down toward the center of the water. She only had to reach it in time. The maneuver was an old standby. She would catch the weapon and kill the three remaining men in a single, spinning somersault.\n\nBut as she ran, her feet became heavy, and it seemed impossible to draw enough air into her pained lungs. ''Thirty strides.'' She had to make the distance before the second man's body hit the ground. ''Twenty strides.'' The muscles in her legs cramped, refusing to obey her commands. ''Fifteen strides.'' She found herself sliding, stumbling. ''No. Not yet.''\n\nThen, sooner than she had expected, the second man's body completed its fall and impacted the rocks. The sound was impossible to miss.\n\nOne mistake was enough. The Kthaons were a desert people. The remaining guards had weapons drawn before she took another step.\n\nHer crossblade hit the water between the men and her. Five strides in front of them. Ten strides from her.\n\n''I could make it.'' Every reflex in Sivir's body willed her forward. Instead, she slid to a halt, nearly falling forward.\n\n''Failing to bring enough water. Waiting too long to attack. Misjudging distances. I don't make these mistakes. Why?'' Some other part of Sivir's mind answered. She remembered the moment after Cassiopeia's dagger had pierced her back - she couldn't feel the blade itself. Instead, she felt a sudden, unexpected weight that seemed to steal her breath and crush her lungs.\n\n''&quot;I killed three of you before you heard me&quot;'', Sivir coughed.\n\n''&quot;You don't have a weapon&quot;'', the largest of the Kthaons said.\n\n''&quot;Only because I didn't want your blood in the water&quot;'', she lied.\n\nThe three remaining men exchanged glances. ''They've recognized me.''\n\n''&quot;A year ago, I killed your chieftain and two dozen of your finest for a bag of thin gold. It was a cheap price for their lives.&quot;'' She met the three men's eyes. They were spreading out from the water, attempting to flank her.\n\n''&quot;The gold I earned from killing your chieftain and kinsmen?&quot;'' she asked. ''&quot;I gambled it away in a single evening.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We will avenge them and your insult&quot;'', the largest man responded.\n\n''&quot;I shouldn't have killed them&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;not for that gold. Don't make me kill you for a few cups of water.&quot;''\n\nThe Kthaons' leader nervously adjusted the grip on his weapon.\n\n''&quot;I'm telling you I can make it to the blade before you can act&quot;'', Sivir explained. ''&quot;And if I run for my blade. You will die.&quot;'' She indicated the foul brown water. ''&quot;Your lives are worth more than that.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then we will die with honor&quot;'', the largest man decided, though his fellows seemed less certain.\n\n''&quot;Did I need that weapon to kill the twenty men you want to avenge?&quot;'' Sivir warned. ''&quot;You are too few.&quot;''\n\nThe three men hesitated. They knew Sivir's reputation. The other two pulled the largest man away, before backing to their mounts.\n\nSivir edged toward the water.\n\n''&quot;We will return with our tribesmen for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Lots of people have tried that&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;Never worked out for them.&quot;''\n\nSivir rolled her swollen tongue against the top of her mouth, desperate for relief. Every part of her wanted to kneel down to the water and drink. ''I have to wait until they cross the far dune.''\n\nAs the men climbed into their saddles and rode away, the strange rumbling sounded again. It was loud and growing louder. ''It's not horses or shifting sands.'' Sivir turned to its source and watched as a three-foot wall of blue water rushed down the ancient riverbed. ''The water from the city.''\n\nThe moment before the water hit Sivir, she felt the rush of cold, damp air in front of the flood. It shocked her like an unexpected kiss.\n\nThe first wave nearly took out her knees. The impact stung with cold, but as it enveloped her waist and legs, it became soothingly cool. Sivir laid in the water, letting it wash over her. She could feel the painful grit of the desert washing away as her hair floated weightless and free.\n\n''I was dead. I must make that mean something.''\n\n", "id": 15}, "Riven": {"key": "Riven", "name": "Riven", "title": "the Exile", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Riven\n|alias      = * The Exile\n|weapon_pet = * {{ai|Blade of the Exile|Riven}}\n|render     = [[File:Riven Render.png|link=|240px]]\n|gender     = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race       = Human\n|birthplace = [[Noxus]]\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--[[The Institute of War]]---&gt;\n|occupation = * Wanderer \n* &lt;s&gt;[[Noxus|Noxian]] soldier&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Member of the Crimson Elite{{w|Alternate history|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction    = * Independent \n* &lt;small&gt;(Crimson Elite{{w|Alternate history|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies     = \n|friends    = \n|rivals     = Yasuo, Varus\n|enemies    = Singed\n|related    = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 92}, "Orianna": {"key": "Orianna", "name": "Orianna", "title": "the Lady of Clockwork", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Orianna\n|real_name    = Orianna Reveck\n|alias        = * The Lady of Clockwork\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Command: Attack|Orianna|The Ball}}\n|render       = [[File:Orianna Render.png|390px|link=]]\n|gender       = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Female\n|race         = {{w|Robot}} &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Techmaturgical construct)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Piltover]]\n|residence    = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation   = * Dancer\n|faction      = * [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Blitzcrank\n|rivals       = Viktor\n|related=\n|render = [[File:Orianna Render.png|215px]]\n}}\n== Lore ==\n&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.---&gt;\n''This lore is out-dated and is no longer considered {{w|canon}}.''\n\n", "background": "here once was a [[Piltover|Piltovian]] man named Corin Reveck who had a daughter named '''Orianna''', whom he loved more than anything else in the world.

Feeling alienated by the chaotic whimsy of other yordles, she preferred to soak up stability and structure where she could find it.

Unlike the other travelers, these people seemed to move with purpose. They all awoke at exactly the same time each morning, roused by the sound of a watchman\u2019s horn. They took their meals together every day at the same hour, always finishing within a few minutes. They set up their camps and took them down with remarkable efficiency.\n\nWhile yordles used their innate magic to fashion extraordinary things, these humans achieved equally astounding feats through coordination and discipline. They acted in concert like the cogs of a gear, becoming something much larger and stronger than any single person could ever be. To Poppy, that was more marvelous than all the magic in the world.\n\nAs Poppy watched the camp from the safety of her hiding place, her eyes caught the gleam of armor emerging from a tent. It was the group\u2019s commanding officer, wearing a brigandine of gleaming steel plates, each piece overlapping, each an integral part of the whole. The man\u2019s name was Orlon, and his presence seemed to stir the souls of everyone there. If someone became discouraged, he was there to remind them of why they pressed on. If someone collapsed from exhaustion, he inspired them to get up. It reminded Poppy of certain yordle charms, though again, without magic.\n\nPoppy crept in for a closer look. She found herself following this shining commander, as if drawn to him by fate itself. She observed Orlon as he led his soldiers in training exercises. He was not a large fellow, yet he swung his massive battle hammer with surprising alacrity. At night, Poppy listened intently to his hushed discussions with the elders of the camp. She heard them making plans to pull up stakes and head west to build a permanent settlement.\n\nPoppy\u2019s mind was overwhelmed with questions. Where was Orlon going? Where did he come from? How did he assemble this meticulous band of travelers, and was there a place for a yordle in it? At that moment, she made the most important decision in her life: For the first time ever, she would reveal herself to a human, as this was the first time she\u2019d ever felt a connection with one.\n\nThe introduction was a jarring one, with Orlon having just as many questions for Poppy as she had for him, but the two soon became inseparable. He became a mentor to her, and she a devotee to his cause. In the training grounds, Poppy was an invaluable sparring partner\u2013the only member of Orlon\u2019s battalion who was unafraid to strike him. She was never obsequious, questioning his decisions with an almost childlike innocence, as though she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to meekly follow orders. She accompanied him to the site of the new settlement\u2013an ambitious new nation called Demacia, where all were welcome, regardless of station or background, so long as they contributed to the good of the whole.\n\nOrlon became a beloved figure throughout the kingdom. Though few had actually seen him wield his hammer, he always bore it on his back, and the weapon quickly became a revered icon for the fledgling nation. People whispered that it had the power to level mountains and tear the earth itself asunder.\n\nOrlon passed the hammer to Poppy on his deathbed, and with it, his hope of an enduring kingdom. It was only then that Orlon told her the story of his weapon\u2019s creation, and how it was never truly intended for his hands. He explained to Poppy that the hammer was meant to go to the Hero of Demacia\u2013the only one who could keep Demacia whole. As her friend drew his last breath, Poppy swore to him that she would find this hero and place the weapon in his hands.\nBut what Poppy possesses in resolve, she lacks in ego, as it never even occurred to her that she might be the hero Orlon described.\n\n", "id": 78}, "Karthus": {"key": "Karthus", "name": "Karthus", "title": "the Deathsinger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Karthus\n|alias = The Deathsinger\n|render = Karthus Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Lich &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Death Worshipper\n* Death Preacher\n* &lt;small&gt;(Singer for [[Pentakill (band)|Pentakill]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Mordekaiser, Thresh\n|rivals = Soraka\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/karthus?_k=hds01n Deathsinger]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Death is not the end of the journey, it is just the beginning... &quot;'' - {{ci|Karthus}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance. The living fear the eternity of undeath, but Karthus sees only beauty and purity in its embrace, a perfect union of life and death. When Karthus emerges from the Shadow Isles, it is to bring the joy of death to mortals as an apostle of the unliving.\n\n==Lore==\nKarthus was born into abject poverty in the sprawl of dwellings built beyond the walls of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] capital. His mother died at the moment of his birth, leaving his father to raise him and his three sisters alone. They shared a crumbling, rat-infested almshouse with scores of other families, subsisting on a diet of rainwater and vermin. Of all the children, Karthus was the best ratter, and regularly brought gnawed corpses for the cook-pot.\n\nDeath was commonplace in the slums of Noxus, and many mornings began with the wailing of bereaved parents who woke to discover their child cold and lifeless beside them. Karthus learned to love these laments, and would watch, fascinated, as the tally-men of {{ci|Kindred}} notched their staffs and bore the bodies from the almshouse. At night the young Karthus would sneak through the cramped rooms, seeking those whose lives hung by a thread, hoping to witness the moment their soul passed from life to death. For years, his nightly travels were fruitless, as it was impossible to predict exactly when a person would die. He was denied witnessing the moment of death until it reached his own family.\n\nOutbreaks of disease were frequent in such cramped confines, and when Karthus' sisters sickened with the plague, he watched over them intently. While his father drowned his grief, Karthus was the ever dutiful brother, caring for his sisters as the disease consumed them. He watched each of them as they died, and a sublime connection seemed to reach into him as the light faded from their eyes - a yearning to see what lay beyond death and unlock the secrets of eternity. When the tally-men came for the bodies, Karthus followed them back to their temple, asking them question after question about their order and the workings of death. Could a person exist at the moment where life ends, but before death begins? If such a liminal moment could be understood and held, might the wisdom of life be combined with the clarity of death?\n\nThe tally-men quickly recognized Karthus' suitability for their order and he was inducted into their ranks, first as a digger of graves and pyre-builder, before ascending to the rank of corpse collector. Karthus guided his bone-cart around the streets of Noxus to gather the dead every day. His dirges quickly became known throughout Noxus, mournful laments that spoke to the beauty of death and the hope that what lay beyond was something to be embraced. Many a grieving family took solace in his songs, finding a measure of peace in his heartfelt elegies. Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple itself, tending to the sick in their final moments, watching as whatever death had laid its claim upon them took its due. Karthus would speak to each person laid before him, ushering their souls into death, in search of further wisdom in their fading eyes.\n\nEventually, Karthus reached the conclusion that he could learn no more from mortals, that only the dead themselves could answer his questions. None of the dying souls could tell of what lay beyond, but whispered rumors and tales told to frighten children echoed of a place where death was not the end - The [[Shadow Isles]].\n\nKarthus emptied the temple's coffers and bought passage to [[Bilgewater]], a city plagued by [[The Black Mist|a strange black mist]] said to draw souls to a cursed island far out at sea. No captain was willing to take Karthus to the Shadow Isles, but eventually he came upon a rum-sodden fisherman with a mountain of debts and nothing to lose. The boat plied the ocean for many days and nights, until a storm drove them onto the rocks of an island that appeared on no charts. A black mist rolled out from a haunted landscape of gnarled trees and tumbled ruins. The fisherman freed his boat and turned its prow in terror for Bilgewater, but Karthus leapt into the sea and waded ashore. Steadying himself with his notched tally-staff, he proudly sang the lament he had prepared for the moment of his own death, and his words were carried on a cold wind to the heart of the island.\n\nThe black mist flowed through Karthus, ravaging his flesh and spirit with ancient sorcery, but such was the force of his desire to transcend mortality that it did not destroy him. Instead, it remade him, and Karthus was born anew in the waters of the island as a fleshless revenant.\n\nRevelation filled Karthus as he became what he always believed he should have been; a being poised at the threshold of death and life. The beauty of this eternal moment filled him with wonder as the wretched spirits of the island rose to behold his transformation, drawn to his passion like predators scenting blood in the ocean. Finally, Karthus was where he belonged, surrounded by those who truly understood the boon undeath truly was. Filled with righteous zeal, he knew he had to return to [[Valoran]] and share his gift with the living, to free them from petty mortal concerns.\n\nKarthus turned and the Black Mist bore him over the waves to the fisherman's boat. The man fell to his knees before Karthus, begging for his life, and Karthus granted him the blessing of death, ending his mortal suffering and raising him up as an immortal spirit as he sang his lament for passing souls. The fisherman was the first of many such souls Karthus would free, and soon the Deathsinger would command a legion of unliving wraiths. To Karthus' awakened senses, the Shadow Isles was in a state of apathetic limbo, where the blessings of death were squandered. He would galvanize the dead in a crusade to bring the beauty of oblivion to the living, to end the suffering of mortality and usher in a glorious age of undeath.\n\nKarthus has become the emissary of the Shadow Isles, the herald of oblivion whose laments are paeans to the glory of death. His legions of unbound souls join with his funereal dirges, their haunting song reaching beyond the Black Mist to be heard on cold nights over graveyards and charnel houses all across Valoran.\n\n;Burial at Sea\nThe sea was mirror-smooth and dark. A pirate's moon hung low on the horizon as it had for the last six nights. Not so much as a whisper of wind stirred the air, only that damned dirge carried from who knew where. Vionax had sailed the oceans around [[Noxus]] long enough to know that seas like this only ever presaged ill-fortune. She stood on the Darkwill's foredeck, training her spyglass on the far ocean, searching for anything she could use to plot their position.\n\n''&quot;Nothing but sea in all directions&quot;'', she said to the night. ''&quot;No land in sight and no stars I recognize. Our sails are empty of wind. The oar decks have rowed for days, but no matter which way we turn, land never comes and the moon neither waxes nor wanes.&quot;''\n\nShe took a moment to rub the heels of her palms against her face. Thirst and hunger growled in her belly and the constant darkness had made it impossible to accurately gauge the passage of time. The Darkwill wasn't even her ship. She'd been it's first mate until a [[Freljord]]ian reaver's axe had split Captain Mettok's skull and given her a sudden promotion. The captain and fifteen other Noxian warriors were laid within sewn-up hammocks on the main deck. The growing stench rising from the bodies was the only consistent measure of time's passing.\n\nShe lifted her gaze to the open ocean and her eyes widened as she saw thick black mist rising from the water. Shapes moved in the mist, lambent suggestions of clawed arms and gaping mouths. That damned dirge rang out over the water again, louder now and accompanied by the dolorous peals of a funeral bell.\n\n''&quot;[[The Black Mist]]&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;All hands on deck!&quot;''\n\nShe turned and vaulted down to the main deck, running for the quarterdeck and the ship's wheel. Not that she could do anything to move the ship, but she'd be damned if she'd be found anywhere else. A haunting lament for lost souls drifted over the ship as men stumbled from below decks, and even as terror shivered her spine, Vionax couldn't deny the poetry in the sound. Tears pricked her eyes and ran down her cheeks, not in fear, but from infinite sadness.\n\n''&quot;Let me end your grief.&quot;''\n\nThe voice in her head was cold and lifeless, the voice of a dead man. It conjured the image of iron-rimmed wheels on a corpse-heaped cart, a knife cutting yet another death mark on a staff. Vionax knew the tales of the Black Mist; she knew to avoid the islands brooding beneath the darkness in the east. She'd thought the ship was far from the [[Shadow Isles]], but she was wrong.\n\nShe pulled up short as black mist boiled up over the gunwale, bringing with it howls and screeches of dead things. Wraiths spun overhead, a swirling chorus of the damned, and the Darkwill's crew cried out in terror at the sight of them. Vionax drew her pistol and cocked the hammer as a figure loomed from the mist; towering and wide-shouldered, robed in tattered vestments like an ancient prelate, yet his shoulders and gaunt skull were armored as a warrior. A chained book hung at his waist and he carried a long staff with its haft notched by countless tally-marks. Spectral light shone at its tip and burned like a fallen star in the palm of his free hand.\n\n''&quot;Why do you cry?&quot;'' said the creature. ''&quot;I am {{ci|Karthus}}, and I bring you a great gift.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I don't want your gift&quot;'', said Vionax, pulling the trigger. Her pistol boomed and fire exploded from the barrel. The shot struck the monstrous wraith, but passed through it without harm.\n\n''&quot;You mortals&quot;'', said Karthus, shaking his helmeted head. ''&quot;You fear what you do not understand and would turn away from a boon that is freely offered.&quot;''\n\nThe monster drifted closer, and the dark radiance of his staff bathed the ship's deck in pale, sickly light. Vionax backed away from the wraith's chill as her crew fell before the light, their souls drifting like steam from their bodies. Her heel caught on one of the laid out hammocks and she tripped, falling backwards onto her haunches. She pushed herself away from Karthus, scrambling over the bodies of her fellow sailors.\n\nThe hammock beneath her moved.\n\nThey were all moving, squirming and writhing like fresh-caught fish gasping for air at the bottom of a boat. Tendrils of mist rose from tears in the canvas and between the rough stitches the ship's sailmaker had used to sew them shut. Faces moved in the mist, faces she'd sailed with for years, men and women she'd fought beside.\n\nThe wraith towered over her and the dead crew of the Darkwill stood beside him, their spirit forms limned in moonlight.\n\n''&quot;Death is nothing to be feared, Mistress Vionax&quot;'', said Karthus. ''&quot;It will free you from all your pain. It will lift your eyes from your mundane existence and show you the glory of life eternal. Embrace the beauty and wonder of death. Let go of your mortality. You do not need it.&quot;''\n\nHe held his hand out and the light there swelled to envelop her. She screamed as it pressed through her skin, into muscle, through bone, down to her very soul. The wraith {{ai|Lay Waste|Karthus|clenched his fist}} and Vionax cried out as she felt herself being unwoven from the inside out.\n\n''&quot;Let your soul fly free&quot;'', said Karthus, turning to carve another notch in his staff with a sharpened nail. ''&quot;You shall feel no pain, no fear, no desire to feel anything but the beauty of what I have to show you. Miracles and wonders await, mortal. Why would you not crave such rapture... ?&quot;''\n\n''No&quot;'', she said with her last breath. ''&quot;I don't want to see.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is already done&quot;'', said Karthus.\n\n", "id": 30}, "Jayce": {"key": "Jayce", "name": "Jayce", "title": "the Defender of Tomorrow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jayce\n|render = Jayce Render.png\n|alias = The Defender of Tomorrow\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Transform: Mercury Hammer|Jayce|Mercury Hammer}}\n* {{ai|Transform: Mercury Cannon|Jayce|Mercury Cannon}}\n* {{ai|Hextech Capacitor|Jayce}}\n* {{ai|Acceleration Gate|Jayce}}\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Inventor\n* [[Piltover]]'s Defender\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n* &lt;small&gt;(The Resistance {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Caitlyn, Ezreal, Vi\n|rivals = Viktor\n|enemies = Jinx\n|related = [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Trust me: if we're smart, [[Piltover]] can stand strong against any threat.

Eager to make a name for himself, he began developing a device to harness its power.\n\nWord of the crystal's potential reached beyond the borders of Piltover. {{ci|Viktor}}, the machine-augmented scientist from [[Zaun]], brought Jayce an offer - together, they could use the crystal to advance his {{ai|Glorious Evolution|Viktor|'glorious evolution'}}, a vision of humanity fused with technology.\n\nJayce refused, but the Zaunite had no intention of leaving empty handed. He effortlessly {{ai|Death Ray|Viktor|blasted}} Jayce aside and seized the crystal, incinerating the lab's meager security force as he left for Zaun.\n\nJayce implored the Piltover government to respond, but the officials refused to support an act of aggression. He decided to act alone, realizing that if no one struck back, Piltover would never be safe.\n\nJayce returned to the lab to prepare for his attack. After intense research, development, and hands-on testing, he emerged with his crowning achievement - the {{ai|Transform: Mercury Hammer|Jayce|Mercury Hammer}}.\n\nWeapon in hand, Jayce marched to Zaun and began his one-man assault. Viktor's acolytes rushed to stop him, but Jayce {{ai|Thundering Blow|Jayce|smashed}} them aside, fighting his way into the heart of the lab.\n\nInside, Jayce saw the horrifying brilliance of Viktor's creations, all powered by the energy of the arcane crystal. He realized that his only option was to destroy the power source, but Viktor stood in his way.\n\nThough their clash left both scientists heavily wounded, Jayce managed a desperate strike at the crystal. He shattered it and escaped as Viktor's machines erupted in flames.\n\nWhen he returned home, exhausted but victorious, the citizens of Piltover hailed Jayce as a hero. He reveled in the adoration, but knew that his actions had drawn the attention of dangerous enemies.\n\nNow devoted to the defense of his people, Jayce is Piltover's best hope for a bright future.  \n\n", "id": 126}, "Blitzcrank": {"key": "Blitzcrank", "name": "Blitzcrank", "title": "the Great Steam Golem", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Blitzcrank\n|alias = The Great Steam Golem \n|render = Blitzcrank Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Steam Golem &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Techmaturgical Construct)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Piltover Policeman {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Rammus, Orianna, Viktor\n|rivals = \n|related = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Though {{ci|Blitzcrank}} may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has a heart of gold... encased in a framework of iron... in a carapace of steel.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\n[[Zaun]] is a place where both magic and science have gone awry, and the unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city.

In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.\n\nBacked by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity.

Where others succumbed to the harshness of the [[Freljord]], she was tempered by it until pain became power, hunger an encouragement, and frost an ally in culling the weak. Through her ordeals, she learned that to thrive in the endless winter, one must become just as cold and unforgiving. In Sejuani's eyes, her followers either have the mettle to endure or the right to die. Once she has conquered the Freljord, she knows that those who survive will form a nation to be feared.\n\n", "background": "s a child, the leader of the Winter's Claw watched her tribe's numbers slowly dwindle.

In desperation, she sought spiritual counsel from her tribe's mystic. But the seer did not foretell Sejuani's death. Instead, she prophesized that Sejuani would one day conquer and unite the divided tribes of the Freljord.\n\nArmored with absolute faith in her destiny, Sejuani pushed herself to extremes that would have killed anyone without her will to endure. She walked into blizzards without food or furs and trained while frigid winds raked her flesh. She clashed with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs gave out beneath her. When she assumed leadership of her tribe, Sejuani commanded her warriors to follow her example.

On the first day of winter, envoys from {{cis|Ashe}} tribe approached Sejuani's camp bearing a gift of Avarosan grain. Ashe's intent was clear: if Sejuani united with her tribe, the Winter's Claw would never go hungry again. To Sejuani, the gift was an insult. In Ashe's tribe, she saw men and women, slight and soft, who preferred to farm instead of fight. Her contempt for them was absolute.\n\nSejuani gathered her people and set the grain alight.

Smuggling himself to the mainland in the bilge of an outgoing cargo ship as a youth, he stole, lied, and gambled his way from place to place. But it was across the table of a high-stakes card game that Malcolm met the man who would change his life: the trickster now known as {{ci|Twisted Fate}}. Both men saw the same reckless love of danger and adventure in the other, and a dysfunctional partnership that lasted nearly a decade was born.\n\nCombining their unique skills, Graves and Twisted Fate were an effective team, pulling off scores of heists. They stole from and swindled the rich and foolish for cash, fame, and the sheer thrill. Adventure became as much of a lure as the payoff.\n\nOn the borderlands of [[Noxus]], they set two renowned houses at each other's throats as cover for the rescue of an heir apparent being held hostage. That they pocketed the reward money only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder should have come as no surprise to their employer. In [[Piltover]], they hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the two empty the vault of its treasures, but they tricked its guards into loading it onto their hijacked cargo ship. Only once the pair were over the horizon was the theft discovered, along with Fate's trademark playing card.\n\nBut eventually their luck ran out. During a heist that went wrong, Twisted Fate seemingly betrayed and abandoned his partner. Graves was taken alive and thrown in the infamous prison known as the Locker.\n\nYears of imprisonment and torture followed, during which time Graves nursed his hatred for his former partner. A lesser man would surely have broken, but Malcolm Graves endured it all and finally escaped. He clawed his way to freedom and began his pursuit of Twisted Fate, the man whose treachery consigned him to a decade of unspeakable misery.\n\nYears later, Graves finally had his showdown with Twisted Fate. Yet, after learning the truth of what had gone down between them and escaping certain death at the hands of {{ci|Gangplank}} with his old comrade, Graves put his vengeance aside. Older, if not wiser, the pair look to pick up where they left off, seeking to make themselves rich using their unique blend of trickery, heists, and focused violence.\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P2.png|left|150px]]\n\nHoled up in an empty bar, bleeding from a dozen wounds and surrounded by armed men who wanted him dead, Malcolm Graves had seen better days. He'd seen worse ones, too, so he wasn't worried yet. Graves leaned over the smashed bar and helped himself to a bottle, sighing as he read the label.\n\n''&quot;[[Demacia]]n wine? That all you got?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's the most expensive bottle I have... &quot;'' said the innkeeper, cowering below the bar in a glittering ocean of broken glass.\n\nGraves looked around the bar and grinned.\n\n''&quot;I reckon it's the only bottle you got left.&quot;''\n\nThe man had panic written all over him. He clearly wasn't used to being in the middle of a gunfight. This wasn't [[Bilgewater]], where fatal brawls broke out ten times a day. [[Piltover]] was regarded a more civilized city than Graves' hometown. In some ways, at least.\n\nHe yanked the cork free with his teeth and spat it to the floor before taking a swig. He swilled it around his mouth like he'd seen rich folks do before swallowing it.\n\n''&quot;Pisswater&quot;'', he said, ''&quot;but beggars can\u2019t be choosers, huh?&quot;''\n\nA voice shouted through the broken windows, buoyed with confidence it hadn't earned and the false bravado of numbers.\n\n''&quot;Give it up, Graves. There's seven of us to one of you. This ain't going to end well.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Damn straight it ain't&quot;'', hollered Graves in return. ''&quot;If you want to walk away from this, you best go fetch more men!&quot;''\n\nHe took another swig from the bottle, then put it down on the bar.\n\n''&quot;Time to get to work&quot;'', he said, lifting {{ai|New Destiny|Graves|his one-of-a-kind shotgun}} from the bar.\n\nGraves reloaded, pushing fresh shells home. The weapon snapped together with a satisfyingly lethal sound, loud enough to carry to the men outside. Anyone who knew him would know that sound and what it meant.\n\nThe outlaw slid off the barstool and made his way to the door, glass crunching beneath his boot heels. He stooped to glance through a cracked window. Four men crouched behind makeshift cover: two on the upper floor of a fancy workshop, another two in shadowed doorways to either side. All held crossbows or muskets at the ready.\n\n''&quot;We tracked you halfway across the world, you son of a bitch&quot;'', shouted the same voice. ''&quot;Bounty didn't say nothin' about you being alive or dead. Walk out now with that cannon of yours held high and there don't need to be no more bloodshed.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Oh, I'm comin' out&quot;'', shouted Graves. ''&quot;Don't you worry none about that.&quot;''\n\nHe drew a {{ai|Silver Serpent|Gangplank}} from his pocket and flipped it onto the bar, where it spun through a pool of spilled rum before landing heads up. A trembling hand reached up to take it. Graves grinned.\n\n''&quot;That's for the door&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;What about the door?&quot;'' asked the innkeeper.\n\nGraves hammered his boot into the inn's front door, smashing it from its hinges. {{ai|Quickdraw|Graves|He dived}} through the splintered frame, rolling to one knee, gun blasting from the hip.\n\n''&quot;Alright, you bastards!&quot;'' he roared.

After breaking free, he wandered [[Runeterra]] until he found himself taken in by his yordle descendants. But, as they would soon discover, there's {{ci|Mega Gnar|a beast}} behind the boy.\n\n==Lore==\n\n: ''Narrated by {{cbi|Rengar}}''\n\n[[File:Gnar lore 2.png|left|150px]]\n\nThe jungle does not forgive blindness. Every broken branch tells a story.\n\nI've hunted every creature this jungle has to offer. I was certain there were no challenges left here, but now there is something new. Each track is the size of a tusklord; its claws like scimitars. It could rend a man in half. Finally, worthy prey.\n\nAs I stalk my prize through the jungle, I begin to see the damage this thing has wrought. I step into a misshapen circle of splintered trees. These giant wooden sentinels have stood over this land for countless ages, their iron-like hides untouched by the flimsy axes of anyone foolish enough to attempt to cut them down. This thing brushed them aside like they were twigs.\n\nHow can a creature with this level of strength disappear so easily? And yet, even though it has left this unmistakable trail of destruction, I have been unable to lay my eye upon it. How can it appear like a hurricane then fade into the jungle like the morning mist?\n\nI thrill in anticipation of finally standing before this creature. It will make a tremendous trophy.\n\nPassing through the clearing, I follow the sound of a stream to get my bearings once more. There I see a small shock of orange fur, crouching, waiting. I spy on it from a distance. A tiny fish splashes out of the stream and the creature scrambles for it, diving gleefully into the rushing water. To my joy, I realize it's {{ci|Gnar|a yordle}}. And a hunter, at that!\n\nThis is a good omen. The beast will be found. Nothing will escape me.\n\nThe yordle's large ears perk up and face towards me. He runs on all fours with {{ai|Boomerang Throw|Gnar|a bone boomerang in hand}}, quickly stopping in front of me. He babbles.\n\nI nod in appreciation at the young yordle and venture onwards. I traverse the difficult terrain with ease, trying to pick up any sign of my quarry. As I try to pick up his scent, a distraction. I'm startled by strange chittering. The yordle followed me. I cannot allow him to disrupt my hunt. I face him and point into the distance. He looks at me quizzically. I need to be more insistent, good omen or no.\n\nI rear back and {{ai|Battle Roar|Rengar|let out a roar}}, the wind whipping the yordle's fur and the ground rumbling beneath us. After a few short seconds, he turns his head and, with what I think could be a smile, he holds up his small boomerang. There can be no further delay. I snatch the weapon out of his hand and expertly throw it into a tree, impaling it high amongst the branches. He turns and scrambles for it, {{ai|Hop|Gnar|jumping frantically}}.\n\nI barely get ten paces when a roar shakes me to my very spine. The deafening crack of stone and wood echoes all around. Ahead, a giant tree crashes across my path. The bone weapon of the yordle juts out from its trunk.\n\nAn unearthly growl rises behind me.\n\nI've made a terrible mistake.\n\n[[File:Gnar logo.png|center|400px]]\n\n", "id": 150}, "Lux": {"key": "Lux", "name": "Lux", "title": "the Lady of Luminosity", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lux\n|real_name = Luxanna Crownguard\n|alias = The Lady of Luminosity\n|weapon_pet = * {{ai|Final Spark|Lux|Light Magic}}\n* {{ai|Illumination|Lux|Light Wand}}\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1383.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Lux#Illumination|Light Wand]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nLux Render.png|Regular\nLux Spellthief Render.png|Infiltrator\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n* Infiltrator\n* &lt;small&gt;(Steel Legionnaire {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n* &lt;small&gt;(Steel Legion {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Garen, Ezreal, Janna\n|rivals = Fiora\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Her guiding light makes enemies wary, but they should worry most when the light fades.&quot;'' - {{ci|Garen}}, the Might of Demacia&lt;/center&gt;\n\nBorn to the prestigious Crownguards, the paragon family of [[Demacia]]n service, {{ci|Lux|Luxanna}} was destined for greatness.

Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n\n{{ci|Renekton}} was born to fight. From a young age he was constantly getting into vicious brawls. He had no fear, and was able to hold his own against much older children. It was often pride that led to these confrontations, as Renekton was unable to back down, or let any insult pass. Every evening, he came home with cuts and fresh bruises, and while his more scholarly older brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, disapproved of his street-fighting, Renekton relished it.\n\nNasus soon moved away, having been chosen to join the elite Collegium of the Sun, and in the years he was absent, Renekton\u2019s skirmishes became increasingly serious. On a rare visit home, Nasus was horrified to see his bloodied young brother return home from yet another street fight. Fearing Renekton\u2019s violent nature would see him imprisoned or in an early grave, Nasus helped him enlist in the Shuriman army. Officially, Renekton was too young for this duty, but his older brother\u2019s influence smoothed away this detail.\n\nThe discipline and regimentation of the army was a blessing for Renekton. Within a few years, he rose to become one of Shurima\u2019s most feared and capable war-captains, and he fought on the front line in numerous wars of conquest to expand the empire. He garnered a reputation for ferocity and toughness, but also for honor and bravery. Nasus became a decorated general, and the two of them served in a number of campaigns together, remaining very close despite their inherent differences and frequent disagreements. Nasus\u2019s skill lay in strategy, logistics and history; Renekton\u2019s lay in battle. Nasus planned the wars, and Renekton won them.\n\nRenekton earned the title Gatekeeper of Shurima after fighting a desperate battle in one of the mountain passes bordering Shurima. An invading force had landed on the south coast, striking toward the isolated city of Zuretta. If it was not halted, the city was certain to be razed, and its populace massacred. Outnumbered ten to one, Renekton and a small contingent faced these aggressors, determined to buy time for the city to be evacuated. It was a battle that none expected Renekton to survive, let alone win. He held the pass for a day and a night, long enough for a relief force led by Nasus to arrive. With barely a handful of warriors left standing, none uninjured, Renekton was hailed a hero.\n\nRenekton served on the frontlines for decades, and never lost a battle. His presence was inspiring to those fighting alongside him, and terrifying to his enemies. Victory after victory were his, and such was his reputation that some wars were won without a sword even being lifted, enemy nations surrendering as soon as they heard Renekton was marching on them.\n\nRenekton was of middling years, a grizzled and battle-scarred veteran, when word reached him that his brother was close to death. He raced back to the capital to find Nasus a pale shadow of his former self, having been struck down by a debilitating wasting malady. The sickness was incurable, similar to the rotting curse said to have cut down an entire noble line in antiquity.\n\nNevertheless, Nasus\u2019s greatness was recognized by one and all. As well as being a highly decorated general, he curated the great library of Shurima, and penned many of the finest literary works in the empire. The priesthood proclaimed it to be the sun\u2019s will that he undertake the Ascension ritual.\n\nThe whole city gathered to witness the holy rite, but the tragic illness had taken a terrible toll, and Nasus no longer had the strength to scale the stairs to the Ascension dais. In the ultimate act of self-sacrifice and love, Renekton lifted his brother in his arms, and climbed the final steps, fully expecting to be obliterated in the process by the holy energies of the sun disc. He deemed his sacrifice a small thing to ensure that his brother would live on. He was just a warrior, after all, albeit a talented one, while his brother was a peerless scholar, thinker and general. Renekton knew that Shurima would need Nasus in the years to come.\n\nRenekton was not destroyed, however. Beneath the blinding radiance of the sun disc, both brothers were raised up and remade. When the light faded, two mighty Ascended beings stood before the onlookers, Nasus in his lean, jackal-headed body, and Renekton in his immense, crocodilian form. Their forms seemed apt; the jackal was often regarded as the most clever and cunning of beasts, and the fearless aggression of the crocodile fit Renekton perfectly. Shurima gave thanks to have these new demigods as guardians of the empire.\n\nRenekton had been a mighty war hero before, but now he was an Ascended being, blessed with power beyond mortal understanding. He was stronger and faster than any regular man, and seemed virtually immune to pain. Though Ascended beings were not immortal, their lifespans were dramatically increased, so that they might serve the empire for hundreds of years.\n\nWith Renekton at the head of the Shuriman armies, the empire\u2019s military was all but unstoppable. He had always been a ruthless commander and ferocious fighter, but his new form gave him power beyond belief. He led the soldiers of Shurima to many bloody victories, neither giving nor expecting mercy. His legend spread far beyond the borders of the empire, and it was his enemies that gave him the name Butcher of the Sands, a title he embraced.\n\nThere were those, Nasus among them, who came to believe that a portion of Renekton\u2019s humanity had been lost in his transformation. As the years progressed, he seemed to become crueler, relishing the spilling of blood more than was natural, and whispers circulated of atrocities he committed in the name of war. Nevertheless, he was a staunch defender of Shurima, and he faithfully served a succession of emperors, ensuring the security and greatness of Shurima for hundreds of years.\n\nDuring the reign of the Emperor {{ci|Azir}}, word arrived that a magical {{ci|Brand|being of fire}} had escaped the {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|magical sarcophagus}} that bound it in its underground prison. It had laid waste to a Shuriman town, before fleeing across the desert to the east. Renekton and his brother Nasus set forth to recapture this legendary foe. While they were absent, the young emperor, guided by the manipulations of his magus, {{ci|Xerath}}, attempted to join their ranks and become one of the Ascended. The results were catastrophic.\n\nReneketon and Nasus were a day\u2019s ride from the capital, but even so, they felt the shockwave as the Ascension ritual went awry. Knowing that something terrible had come to pass, they raced back to find the glorious city in ruins. Azir had been killed, along with most of the city\u2019s populace, and the great sun disc was falling, drained of all its power.  At the epicenter of the ruin, they encountered Xerath, now a being of pure, malevolent power.\n\nThe brothers sought to bind Xerath in the magical sarcophagus that had held the ancient being of fire. For a day and a night they battled, but the magus was powerful, and would not be held. He shattered the sarcophagus, and assailed them with spells fueled by the power of sun disc, which crashed to the ground as they fought.\n\nKnowing that they could not destroy Xerath, Renekton finally wrestled him into the depthless Tomb of the Emperors, and bade his brother seal them inside forever. Knowing there was no other way to stop Xerath, Nasus reluctantly did as his brother ordered. As Renekton and Xerath fell into darkness, Nasus sealed the tomb for all eternity.\n\nIn the darkness, Xerath and Renekton continued their battle. For uncounted years they fought, as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed to dust in the world above. Xerath whispered poison in Renekton\u2019s ear, and gradually, as the centuries rolled on, his viperous words and the ever-present darkness took its toll. The magus implanted the notion in Renekton\u2019s mind that Nasus had sealed him in on purpose, jealous of his success, and unwilling to share his Ascension.\n\nPiece by piece, Renekton\u2019s sanity cracked. Xerath drove a wedge into these cracks, corrupting his mind and twisting his perception of what was real and what was imagined.\n\nThousands of years later, the Tomb of the Emperors was opened by the mercenary {{ci|Sivir}}, freeing Renekton and Xerath. Renekton roared his fury and thundered out into the Shuriman desert, sniffing the air for the scent of his brother.\n\nRenekton now roams the deserts, seeking the death of Nasus, the traitor he believes left him to die. His grip on reality is tenuous at best, and while there are moments when he resembles the proud, honorable hero of the past, much of the time he is little more than a devolved hate-maddened beast, driven on by the thirst for blood and vengeance.\n\n", "id": 58}, "Fiora": {"key": "Fiora", "name": "Fiora", "title": "the Grand Duelist", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Fiora\n|real_name = Fiora Laurent\n|alias = The Grand Duelist\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Bladework|Fiora|Laurent Bluesteel Rapier}}\n* &lt;small&gt;({{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|Zero Pulse Blade}} {{w|Alternative future|* }})&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Fiora Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n* Head of House Laurent \n* &lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiate {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n* [[File:House Laurent Crest.png|18px|link=]] [[Demacia|House Laurent]]\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Jax, Lux\n|related = \n* [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;I have come to kill you for the sake of honor.

House Laurent's reputation was sundered, but Fiora bends her every effort to restore her family's honor and return them to their rightful place among the great and good of Demacia.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:House Laurent Crest.png|left|150px]]\n\nFrom an early age, Fiora defied every expectation placed upon her. Her mother had the finest craftsmen of Demacia fashion the most lifelike dolls for her. Fiora gave them to her maids and took up her brother's rapier, forcing him to give her lessons in secret. Her father obtained a host of dressmaking mannequins for her personal seamstress to craft wondrous dresses. Fiora used them to practice {{ai|Lunge|Fiora|lunges}} and {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|ripostes}}.\n\nAt every stage in her life, Fiora has embodied all that is noble in Demacia, striving for perfection in all things and brooking no insult to her honor or that of her family's ideals. As the youngest daughter of House Laurent, she was destined for a life as a political pawn, to be married off in the grand game of alliances between patrician houses. This did not sit well with Fiora, whose temperament saw only dishonor in being maneuvered by another's will, even that of her beloved father. Despite her resistance, a politically advantageous marriage was arranged with an outlying branch of {{ci|Garen|House}} {{ci|Lux|Crownguard}}, and plans were set for a summer wedding.\n\nThe ancient families of Demacia sent their invited representatives to House Laurent to attend the marriage ceremony, but instead of meekly accepting her fate, Fiora defied it. She declared before the assembled host that she would sooner die than be dishonored by allowing someone else to control her fate. Her husband-to-be was publicly shamed and his family demanded a duel to the death to wipe away Fiora's scandalous insult.\n\nFiora immediately stepped forward, but as Master of House Laurent, it was her father's duty to accept. The champion of House Crownguard was a truly deadly warrior, and defeat was almost certain. To lose would see House Laurent ruined and his daughter exiled in disgrace. Presented with so stark a choice, Fiora's father made a decision that would damn his family for years to come. That night, he attempted to drug his opponent with a draught to rob his blows of speed, but his attempt was discovered and the Master of House Laurent was arrested.\n\nDemacian law is notoriously harsh and unforgiving. Its justice allows no leeway, and Fiora's father had broken its most fundamental code of honor. He would suffer public humiliation upon the executioner's scaffold, hanged like a common criminal, and his entire family expelled from Demacia. On the eve of his death, Fiora visited her father's cell, but what passed between them is a secret known only to her.\n\nAn ancient and all but forgotten code of honor allowed for a family member to expunge the shame of one of its number in blood, and thus avoid the virtual death-sentence of exile. Knowing they had no choice, father and daughter faced each other within the Hall of Blades. Justice would not be served by a mere slaying, Fiora's father had to fight and be fought. The battle was blindingly swift, {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|a dance of blades}} so exquisite that those who witnessed it would never forget what they had seen. Fiora's father was a fine swordsman in his own right, but he was no match for his daughter. They said farewell in every clash of the blade, but in the end a tearful Fiora buried her rapier in {{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|her father's heart}} and assured her family's continued place in Demacia. With her father dead at her feet, Fiora became the head of House Laurent (much to the surprise of her older brothers... )\n\nThough the honor of House Laurent was not entirely ruined, scandals are not easily erased. In the years that followed, Fiora proved a sagacious leader of her House and swiftly learned not to make the mistakes of brash youth. She became a formidable mistress of blade and negotiation, cutting to the heart of any matter with her customary clarity and seemingly cruel directness. Some still speak of her House's disgrace or decry how standards have fallen that a woman should dare call herself ruler of a noble House, but only in private. For when such gossip reaches Fiora's ear, she is quick to call out those rumormongers and {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|demand justice}} on the edge of a sword. Yet even here, she is not without pragmatic cunning, offering each challenger a way out that will allow honor to be satisfied without death. So far, none have accepted her offers, and none have ever walked away from a duel with Fiora.\n\nWith the fortunes of House Laurent on the rise, Fiora has no shortage of suitors, but none have yet proven worthy of her hand. Many suspect Fiora herself puts every suitor through an impossible gauntlet of courtship in order to remain aloof and unmarried, for a wife would, traditionally, relinquish power to her husband.\n\nAnd Fiora has never done anything traditionally.\n\n[[File:House Laurent Crest.png|left|150px]]\n\nThe man {{ci|Fiora}} was going to kill was named Umberto. He had the look of a man very sure of himself. She watched him talking to four men, so alike they must surely be his brothers. The five of them were cocksure and preening, as though it was beneath their dignity to even present themselves in the Hall of Blades in answer to her challenge.\n\nDawn's light cast angled spars of light through the lancet windows, and the pale marble shimmered with the reflections of those who had come to see a life ended. They lined the edges of the hall by the score, members of both Houses, lackeys, gawkers and some simply with unhealthy appetites to see bloodshed.\n\n''&quot;My lady&quot;'', said Ammdar, her second older brother, handing her {{ai|Bladework|Fiora|a mid-length rapier}} with a bluesteel blade upon which light moved like oil. ''&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course&quot;'', replied Fiora. ''&quot;You heard the tales Umberto and his braggart brothers were spreading in the Commercia?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I did&quot;'', confirmed Ammdar. ''&quot;But is that worth his death?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;If I let one braggart slide, then others will think themselves free to wag their tongues&quot;'', said Fiora.\n\nAmmdar nodded, and stepped back. ''&quot;Then do what you must.&quot;''\n\nFiora stepped forward, rolling her shoulders and sweeping her blade twice through the air \u2013 a sign the duel was about to begin. Umberto turned as one his brothers nudged him in the ribs, and anger touched Fiora as she saw his frank appraisal of her physique, an appraisal that lingered far too long below her neck. He drew his own weapon, a long, beautifully curved [[Demacia]]n cavalry saber with golden quillons and a sapphire inset on the pommel. A poseur's weapon and one entirely unsuited to the requirements of a duel.\n\nUmberto stepped up to his duelists' mark and repeated the sword movements she had made. He bowed to her and winked. Fiora felt her jaw tighten, but clamped down on her dislike. Emotion had no place in a duel. It clouded swordplay and had seen many a great swordsman slain by a lesser opponent.\n\nThey circled one another, making the prescribed movements of foot and blade like dance partners at the first notes of a waltz. The movements were to ensure that both participants in the duel were aware of the significance of what they were soon to attempt.\n\nThe rituals of the duel were important. They, like The Measured Tread, were designed to allow civilized folk to maintain the illusion of nobility in killing. Fiora knew they were good laws, just laws, but that didn't take away from the fact that she was about to kill the man before her. And because Fiora believed in these laws, she had to make her offer.\n\n''&quot;Good sir, I am Fiora of House Laurent&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Save it for your grave-marker&quot;'', snapped Umberto.\n\nShe ignored his puerile attempt to rile her and said, ''&quot;It has come to my attention that you did injure the good name of House Laurent in an unjust and dishonorable manner by the indulgence and spreading of malicious falsehoods in regards to the legitimacy of my lineage. Therefore it is my right to {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|challenge you to a duel}} and restore the honor of my House in your blood.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I already know this&quot;'' said Umberto, playing to the crowd. ''&quot;I'm here aren't I?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You have come to your death&quot;'', promised Fiora. ''&quot;Unless you choose not to fight by giving me satisfaction for your offense.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;How might I give milady satisfaction?&quot;'' asked Umberto.\n\n''&quot;Given the nature of your offense, submit to having your right ear severed from your head.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What? Are you mad, woman?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's that or I kill you&quot;'', said Fiora, as though they were discussing the weather. ''&quot;You know how this duel will end. There is no loss of face in yielding.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course there is&quot;'' said Umberto, and Fiora saw he still thought he could win. Like everyone else, he underestimated her.\n\n''&quot;All here know my skill with a blade, so choose to live and wear your wound as a badge of honor. Or choose death, and be food for crows by midmorning.&quot;''\n\nFiora raised her blade. ''&quot;But choose now.&quot;''\n\nHis anger at what he assumed was her arrogance overcame his fear and he stamped forward, the tip of his sword thrusting for her heart. Fiora had read the attack before it was launched and made a quarter turn to the left, letting the curved blade cut only air. Her own blade swept up, then down {{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|in a precise, diagonal arc}}. The crowd gasped at the wet spatter of blood on stone and the shocking suddenness of the duel's ending.\n\nFiora turned as Umberto's sword clattered to the granite flagstones. He fell to his knees, then slumped back onto his haunches, hands clutched to his opened throat from which blood pumped enthusiastically.\n\nShe bowed to Umberto, but his eyes were already glassy and unseeing with impending death. Fiora took no pleasure in such a slaying, but the fool had left her little choice. Umberto's brothers came forward to collect the corpse, and she felt their shock at their brother's defeat.\n\n''&quot;How many is that?&quot;'' asked Ammdar, coming forward to collect her sword. ''&quot;Fifteen? Twenty?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Thirty&quot;'', said Fiora. ''&quot;Or maybe more. They all look the same to me now.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There will be more&quot;'', promised her brother.\n\n''&quot;So be it&quot;'', answered Fiora. ''&quot;But every death restores our family honor. Every death brings redemption closer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Redemption for whom?&quot;'' asked Ammdar.\n\nBut Fiora did not answer.\n\n", "id": 114}, "Jinx": {"key": "Jinx", "name": "Jinx", "title": "the Loose Cannon", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jinx\n|alias = The Loose Cannon\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Pow-Pow|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt;([[File:ProfileIcon1387.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Jinx#Pow=Pow|Shiro]], {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Fishbones|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt;([[File:ProfileIcon1388.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Jinx#Fishbones|Kuro]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Zap!|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}})\n* {{ai|Flame Chompers!|Jinx}}\n* {{ai|Super Mega Death Rocket!|Jinx}}\n|render = Jinx Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Criminal\n* Psychopath\n* &lt;s&gt;[[Zaun]] Gang Member&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]] &lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Ekko\n|friends = \n|rivals = Caitlyn, Vi, Jayce\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n", "background": "[File:Jinx quote.png|center|550px]]\n\n[[File:Jinx's Weapons.png|left]]\n\nJinx lives to wreak havoc without a thought for consequence, leaving a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. A manic and impulsive criminal, she despises nothing more than boredom, and gleefully unleashes her own volatile brand of pandemonium to the one place she finds dullest: [[Piltover]]. With an arsenal of deadly toys, she unleashes the brightest explosions and loudest blasts - all the better to shock and surprise the hapless authorities. Always just out of the law's reach, Jinx's favorite game is to toy with Piltover's finest - especially {{ci|Vi}}.\n\nPiltover had long been known as the City of Progress, a place where peace and order reigned. That serenity was challenged when a new kind of criminal arrived, the likes of whom had never been seen. This mysterious outlaw unleashed a series of warped and destructive capers that endangered the entire city, and left its people reeling from the worst crime spree in Piltover's history.\n\nAs the string of crimes without rhyme or reason hit the city, sightings of the lawbreaker emerged. Though the young woman's origins were a mystery, some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms, while others described the street fashions of [[Zaun]] in her dress. Because her arrival always brought trouble with it, those who crossed her path soon gave her a name: {{ci|Jinx}}.\n\n[[File:Jinx graffity of Vi.png|right|275px]]\n\nJinx's rampage escalated. {{ci|Caitlyn}} - the sheriff of Piltover - responded by declaring a state of emergency and organizing a city-wide manhunt. In typical Jinx fashion, the criminal marked the Piltover treasury, the city's most secure building, with a direct challenge to its most abrasive officer. With a caricature of Vi's face splashed across the treasury's facade, and with a time and date of her supposed raid, Jinx was openly daring the enforcer to stop her from robbing it.\n\nDetermined to put the troublemaker behind bars, Vi watched and waited outside the treasury until Jinx's time had finally come. True to her scrawled promise, the smiling menace showed her face. Knowing this was her chance to capture the outlaw, Vi gave chase into the building's interior. She smashed through wall after wall to chase down Jinx, who giggled as she lit up the evacuated treasury with fiery explosions. Vi finally cornered the criminal inside the vault, but Jinx wasn't done just yet. With a maniacal laugh, she fired a barrage of rockets, bringing the entire building down upon them both.\n\nWhen Vi finally crawled out of the ruins, the battered enforcer found no trace of Jinx. Adding insult to injury, not a single ounce of gold had been taken from the ruined vault. Instead, the criminal left a parting message to her favorite officer of the law - a challenge only now visible through the gaping opening in Piltover's skyline. The lights of the city spelled out a simple taunt: you'll never catch me. As Vi read the message, she heard the distant laughter of her new nemesis, and the city plunged into utter darkness for the very first time.\n\n", "id": 222}, "Kalista": {"key": "Kalista", "name": "Kalista", "title": "the Spear of Vengeance", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kalista\n|alias = \n* The Spear of Vengeance\n* The Lady of Vengeance\n* &lt;s&gt;General Kalista&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Pierce|Kalista|Soul Spears}}\n* {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|Soul Sentinels}}\n* {{ii|The Black Spear}}\n|render = Kalista Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Female\n|race = Specter &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = Spirit of Vengeance\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|enemies = Cassiopeia, LeBlanc, Lissandra, Hecarim, Zed\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/kalista?_k=cw2on3 Spear of Vengeance]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;When wronged, we seek justice.

The betrayed may cry out in blood to be avenged, but Kalista only answers those whose cause she deems worthy of her skills. Woe betide those who become the focus of Kalista's wrath, for {{ii|The Black Spear|any pact}} sealed with this grim hunter can only end on the cold fire of {{ai|Pierce|Kalista|her soul-spears}}.\n\n==Lore==\nIn life, Kalista was a proud general, niece to the powerful {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|king}} of an empire none now recall. She lived by a strict code of honor and expected others to do the same, serving her king and queen with utmost loyalty. Her king had many enemies, and when the rulers of a conquered land sent an assassin to slay him, only the speed of Kalista's sword arm averted disaster. But in saving the king, she damned the queen. The assassin's deflected blade was envenomed and sliced the arm of the king's wife. The greatest priests, surgeons and sorcerers were summoned, but none could draw the poison from the queen's body. Even the king's magic could only slow its progress. Wracked with grief, the king dispatched Kalista to quest for a cure. Before departing, she tasked {{ci|Hecarim}} of the Iron Order to stand at the king's side in her stead. He reluctantly accepted this task, bitter at being denied the chance to join Kalista.\n\nKalista traveled the world, seeking a cure from learned scholars, hermits and mystics, but always without success. Finally, she learned of a legendary island beyond the ken of mortal eyes, a place said to hold the key to eternal life - the Blessed Isles - and set sail on a last voyage of hope. The island's inhabitants knew of her quest and, seeing the purity of her intent, drew her boat to the shores of their island. Kalista begged them to heal the queen, and the master of the order instructed Kalista to bring her to the island, where they would cleanse her body. As Kalista boarded her ship, she was given arcane words to pierce the glamours protecting the island, but was warned against sharing that knowledge. Kalista sailed for her homeland, but arrived too late; the queen was already dead.\n\nThe king had descended into grief-stricken madness, locking himself in his tower with the queen's festering corpse. Her uncle learned of Kalista's return and demanded she tell him what she had found. With heavy heart, for she had never before broken her oath to the king, Kalista refused, remembering the warning given to her and knowing there was no purpose in bringing a corpse to the island. The king named her a traitor and imprisoned her until such time she relented. There Kalista remained until Hecarim convinced her to tell the king what she knew. He urged her to let the king find peace, either in his wife returning to him or in finally accepting she was gone and allowing her to be buried on the Blessed Isles. Between them they could assuage the king's madness and bring him back with no harm being done. Hesitantly, for she sensed something amiss in Hecarim, Kalista agreed.\n\nAnd so the king sailed for the Blessed Isles with a flotilla of his fastest ships. Kalista spoke the mystic words to undo the veil shrouding their destination and the king cried out as its glittering coast was revealed. The king marched towards a distant white city at the centre of the island where he was met by the master of the island's guardians. The king ordered the man to bring his wife back from the dead, but was told that trying to cheat death went against the natural order of the world. The king flew into a fevered rage and commanded Kalista to kill the guardian.\n\nKalista refused and spoke of the great man he had once been, but her appeals fell on deaf ears and he again ordered the guardian's death. Kalista called on Hecarim to stand with her, but Hecarim now saw a chance to realize his long-simmering ambition of replacing Kalista as the king's favorite. He stepped towards Kalista as if to stand at her side, but instead drove {{ii|The Black Spear|his spear}} through her back in a monstrous act of betrayal. The Iron Order joined him in treachery, their own spears plunging into Kalista's body as she fell. A brutal melee erupted, with those devoted to Kalista fighting desperately against Hecarim and his knights. Despite their courage and skill, their numbers were too few and Hecarim's men slew them to a man. As Kalista's life faded and she watched her warriors die, she swore vengeance with her dying breath upon those who had betrayed her.\n\nWhen next Kalista opened {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|her eyes}}, they were filled with the dark power of unnatural magic. The Blessed Isles had been transformed into [[Shadow Isles|a twisted mockery]] of life and beauty, a place of darkness filled with howling spirits condemned for all eternity to the nightmare of undeath. She knew nothing of how this had happened, and even as she clung to her last memories of betrayal, they slowly faded until all that remained was a thirst for vengeance burning in her ruined chest.\n\nA thirst that can only be slaked in the blood of traitors.\n\n;Invocation\nThe sword-wife stood amid the burnt out ruin of her home. Everything and everyone that mattered to her was gone, and she was filled with fathomless grief... and hate. Hate was now all that compelled her.\n\nShe saw again the smile on his face as he gave the order. He was meant to be their protector, but he'd spat upon his vows. Hers was not the only family shattered by the oath-breaker.\n\nThe desire to go after him was strong. She wanted nothing more than to plant her sword in his chest and watch the life drain from his eyes... but she knew she would never be able to get close enough to him. He was guarded day and night, and she was but one warrior. She would never be able to fight her way through his battalion alone. Such a death would serve no purpose.\n\nShe took a shuddering breath, knowing there was no coming back.\n\nA crude effigy of a man, formed of sticks and twine, lay upon a fire-blackened dresser. Its body was wrapped in a scrap of cloth torn from the cloak of the betrayer. She'd pried it from her husband's dead grasp. Alongside it was a hammer and three rusted nails.\n\nShe gathered everything up and moved to the threshold. The door itself was gone, smashed to splinters in the attack. Beyond, lit by moonlight, lay the empty, darkened fields.\n\nReaching up, the sword-wife pressed the stick-effigy to the hardwood lintel.\n\n''&quot;I invoke thee, Lady of Vengeance&quot;'', she said, her voice low, trembling with the depth of her fury. ''&quot;From beyond the veil, hear my plea. Come forth. Let justice be done.&quot;''\n\nShe readied her hammer and the first of the nails.\n\n''&quot;I name my betrayer once&quot;'', she said, and spoke his name aloud. As she did so, she placed the tip of the first nail to the chest of the stick-figure. With a single strike, she hammered it in deep, pinning it to the hardwood door frame.\n\nThe sword-wife shivered. The room had become markedly colder. Or had she imagined it?\n\n''&quot;I name him twice&quot;'', she said, and she did so, hammering the second nail alongside the first.\n\nHer gaze dropped, and she jolted in shock. A dark figure stood out in the moonlit field, a hundred yards in the distance. It was utterly motionless. Breathing quicker, the sword-wife returned her attention to the unfinished task.\n\n''&quot;I name him thrice&quot;'', she said, speaking again the name of the murderer of her husband and children, before hammering home the final nail.\n\nAn ancient spirit of vengeance stood before her, filling the doorway, and the sword-wife staggered back, gasping involuntarily.\n\nThe otherworldly being was clad in archaic armor, her flesh translucent and glowing with spectral un-light. Black Mist coiled around her like a living shroud.\n\nWith a squeal of tortured metal, the spectral figure drew forth {{ii|The Black Spear|the blackened spear}} protruding from her breastplate - the ancient weapon that had ended her life.\n\nShe threw it to the ground before the sword-wife. No words were spoken; there was no need. The sword-wife knew what was being offered to her - vengeance - and knew its terrible cost: her soul.\n\nThe spirit watched on, her face impassive and {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|her eyes burning}} with an unrelenting cold fury, as the sword-wife picked up the treacherous weapon.\n\n''&quot;I pledge myself to vengeance&quot;'', said the sword-wife, her voice quivering. She reversed the spear, aiming the tip inward, towards her heart. ''&quot;I pledge it with my blood. I pledge it with my soul.&quot;''\n\nShe paused. Her husband would have pleaded for her to turn away from this path. He would have begged her not to condemn her soul with this course of action. A moment of doubt gnawed at her. The undying specter watched on.\n\nThe sword-wife's eyes narrowed as she thought of her husband lying dead, cut down by swords and axes. She thought again of her children, sprawled upon the ground, and her resolve hardened like a cold stone in her heart. Her grip tightened upon the spear.\n\n''&quot;Help me&quot;'', she implored, her decision made. ''&quot;Please, help me kill him.&quot;''\n\nShe rammed the spear into her chest, driving it in deep.\n\nThe sword-wife's eyes widened and she dropped to her knees. She tried to speak, but only blood bubbled from her lips.\n\nThe ghostly apparition watched her die, her expression impassive.\n\nAs the last of the lifeblood ran from her body, the shade of the sword-wife climbed to her feet. She looked down at her insubstantial hands in wonder, then at her own corpse lying dead-eyed in a growing pool of blood upon the floor. The shade's expression hardened, and a ghostly sword appeared in her hand.\n\nAn ethereal tether, little more than a wisp of light, linked the newly formed shade to the avenging spirit she had summoned. Through their bond, the sword-wife saw her differently, glimpsing the noble warrior she had been in life: tall and proud, her armor gleaming. Her posture was confident, yet without arrogance; a born leader, a born soldier. This was a commander that the sword-wife would have willingly bled for.\n\nBehind the spirit's anger, she sensed her empathy - recognition of their shared pain of betrayal.\n\n''&quot;Your cause is our cause&quot;'', said {{ci|Kalista}}, the Spear of Vengeance. Her voice was grave cold. ''&quot;We walk the path of vengeance as one, now.&quot;''\n\nThe sword-wife nodded.\n\nWith that, the avenging spirit and the shade of the sword-wife stepped into the darkness and were gone.\n\n", "id": 429}, "Fizz": {"key": "Fizz", "name": "Fizz", "title": "the Tidal Trickster", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Fizz\n|alias = The Tidal Trickster\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Seastone Trident|Fizz}}\n* {{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|Chomper}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=18667799#18667799 IronStylus on Fizz's shark's name]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ci|Urf|(Urf}} {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Fizz Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Ocean Dweller)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Guardian's Sea]]\n|residence = [[Bilgewater]]\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Void Bringer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Bilgewater Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Bilgewater]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Nami\n|rivals = Nautilus, Tahm Kench\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''{{ci|Fizz}} makes even the saltiest sailors of [[Bilgewater]] look like drunken landlubbers in a fight.

Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble. In his many adventures he grew to be a powerful fighter with a sharp cleverness that let him skirt danger with ease.\n\nOne day Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted {{ai|Seastone Trident|Fizz}} from the ruins and set out alone.

To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown. To most, however, it is called the Void.\n\nDespite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things, horrors not meant for minds of men. Though such knowledge is lost in modern times, there are those who have unwittingly discovered what lies beyond, and they have been unable to turn away.\n\nKassadin is such a creature. He was once a man forced to look upon the face of the Void and forever changed by what he saw. Once a seeker of forbidden knowledge, he discovered that what he sought was something else entirely.\n\nHe is one of the few that has found his way to forgotten [[Icathia]] and lived to tell the tale, following the scant breadcrumbs hidden in ancient texts. Within a decaying cyclopean city, {{csl|Kassadin|Pre-Void|Kassadin}} found secrets of the kind that he will never share - secrets that made him quake with fear at the visions of things to come that were thrust upon him.\n\nThe power of the place threatened to consume him forever, but Kassadin took the only route available to him in order to survive - he let the Void inside him. Miraculously, he was able to overcome the alien urges that went with it, and he emerged as something more than human.\n\nThough a part of him died that day, he knows that he must protect [[Valoran]] from the things scratching at the door, waiting to get in and visit their torments upon the world.

Her caretakers were sure she would find a home quickly, but it soon became apparent that what they mistook for uncommon geniality was actually an inability to speak or to produce any sound whatsoever. \n\nSona remained at the adoption house until her teens, watching in hopeless silence as prospective adopters passed her by. During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual instrument to anxious collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the house.\n\nWhen a wealthy [[Demacia]]n woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument, she immediately embarked to Ionia. When the caretakers showcased the instrument for her, she rose wordlessly and explored the house, stopping outside Sona's room. Without hesitation, Lestara adopted her and left a generous donation for the instrument. \n\nWith Lestara's guidance, Sona discovered a deep connection with the instrument which Lestara called an {{ai|Power Chord|Sona|'etwahl'}}.

When caught on the edge of life, louder than any trumpeting horn, it is the hammering pulse at one's throat that calls Kindred to their {{ai|Mark of the Kindred|Kindred|hunt}}. Stand and greet Lamb's silvered bow and {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|her arrows}} will lay you down swiftly. If you refuse her, Wolf will join you for his merry hunt, where every {{ai|Mounting Dread|Kindred|chase}} runs to its brutal end.\n\nFor as long as its people have known death, Kindred has stalked [[Valoran]]. When the final moment comes, it is said a true [[Demacia]]n will turn to Lamb, taking the arrow, while through the shadowed streets of [[Noxus]], Wolf leads the hunt. In the snows of the [[Freljord]], before going off to fight, some warbands 'kiss the Wolf', vowing to honor his chase with the blood of their enemies. After each [[Harrowing]], the town of [[Bilgewater]] gathers to celebrate its survivors and honor those granted a true death by Lamb and Wolf.\n\nDenying Kindred is to deny the natural order of things. There are but a wretched few who have eluded these hunters. This perverse escape is no sanctuary, for it only holds a waking nightmare. Kindred waits for those locked in the undeath of the [[Shadow Isles]], for they know all will eventually fall to Lamb's bow or Wolf's teeth.\n\nThe earliest dated appearance of the eternal hunters is from a pair of ancient masks, carved by unknown hands into the gravesites of people long-forgotten. But to this day, Lamb and Wolf remain together, and they are always Kindred.\n\n;Forest for the Trees\nThe battle spilled over like a feast before them. Such delicious life - so many to end, so many to hunt! {{ci|Wolf}} paced in the snow while {{ci|Lamb}} danced lithely from sword edge to spear tip, the red-blooded butchery never staining her pale coat.\n\n''&quot;There is courage and pain here, Wolf. Many will gladly meet their end.&quot;'' She drew up her bow and let loose an arc of swift finality.\n\nThe last breath of a soldier came with a ragged consent as his shield gave way to a heavy axe. Stuck in his heart was {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|a single white arrow}}, shimmering with ethereal brilliance.\n\n''&quot;Courage bores me&quot;'', the great black wolf grumbled as he tracked through the snow. ''&quot;I am hungry and eager to chase.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Patience&quot;'', she murmured in his shaggy ear. As soon as the words left her, Wolf's shoulders tensed and his body dropped low to the ground.\n\n''&quot;I smell fear&quot;'', he said, trembling with excitement.\n\nAcross the muddied field of snow, a squire - too young for battle, but with blade in hand, nonetheless - saw that Kindred had {{ai|Mark of the Kindred|Kindred|marked}} all in the valley.\n\n''&quot;I want the tender-thing. Does it see us, Lamb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Yes, but it must choose. Feed the Wolf, or embrace me.&quot;''\n\nThe battle turned its steel toward the squire. He now stared at the roiling tide of bravery and desperation coming for him. This would be his last dawn. In that instant, the boy made his choice. He would not go willingly. Until his last breath, he would run.\n\nWolf snapped in the air and rolled his face in the snow like a new pup.\n\n''&quot;Yes, dear Wolf.&quot;'' Lamb's voice echoed like a string of pearly bells. ''{{ai|Mounting Dread|Kindred|&quot;Begin your hunt.&quot;}}''\n\nWith that, Wolf bounded across the field after the youth, a howl thundering through the valley. His shadowed body swept over the remains of the newly dead and their useless, shattered weapons.\n\nThe squire turned and ran for the woods until thick black trunks passed in a blur. He pressed on, the frozen air burning his lungs. He looked once more for his hunter, but could see nothing but the darkening trees. The shadows closed tightly around him and he suddenly realized there was no escape. It was the black body of Wolf that was everywhere at once. The chase was at its end. Wolf buried {{ai|Wolf's Frenzy|Kindred|his sharp teeth}} in the squire's neck, tearing out ribbons of vibrant life.\n\nWolf reveled in the boy's scream and crunching bones. Lamb, who had trailed behind, laughed to see such sport. Wolf turned and asked, in a voice more growl than speech, ''&quot;Is this music, Lamb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is to you&quot;'', she answered.\n\n''&quot;Again&quot;'', Wolf licked the last drop of the youth's life from his canine jaws. ''&quot;I want to chase again, little Lamb.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There are always more&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Until the day there is only {{ci|Kindred}}.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And then will you run from me?&quot;''\n\nLamb turned back to the battle. ''&quot;I would never run from you, dear Wolf.&quot;''\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|Expanded=\n;A Good Death\nMagga was about to die for the fourteenth time. She had bitten into a rotten apple - yet again. Its putrid flesh had, as always, infected her with carrionshade. The actress went through the motions of stumbling to her death while shouting her final words for all to hear.\n\n''&quot;Oh, but how wondrous a dream is life? Only now - too late! - do I wake to see its myriad of splendors&quot;'', she bemoaned.\n\nWith a puff of smoke and glittering powder, {{ci|Kindred}} made a grand entrance upon the stage. As per tradition, they were played by one actor, his head covered by two opposing masks. He approached Magga, the white mask of the {{ci|Wolf|Lamb}} facing her.\n\n''&quot;Hark! Do I hear a plea for my keenest arrow? Come, child, let the warmth of your heart fade into the cold embrace of oblivion.&quot;''\n\nMagga refused, as she had thirteen times before. Any nuance in her performance was buried beneath the ear-splitting delivery of her scream. On cue, Lamb spun around, revealing the second mask - that of the {{ci|Lamb|Wolf}}.\n\n''&quot;There is naught ye can do to stave off thine end&quot;'', growled Wolf. \n\n''&quot;I am but a poor young maiden! Please, let my piteous cry fall on all four of thine ears.&quot;''\n\nThe audience seemed enraptured by the unfolding dramatics of the ''Orphellum Mechanicals''. With the twin threats of plague and war on the tongues of those in neighboring protectorates, death dramas were all the rage.\n\nDenji, the actor portraying both Lamb and Wolf, descended upon the young actress, awkwardly baring wooden fangs. Magga offered her neck. At the threat of Wolf's bite, she triggered the device sewn into her blouse's collar. Ribbons of red fabric unspooled to the delighted pips and yelps of the audience. They'd gotten what they paid for.\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 1.png|center|800px]]\n\nBy the time the Mechanicals had staggered back to their wagon and set off in the direction of Needlebrook, there were no stars to be seen. Instead, a veil of clouds stretched across the night sky.\n\nNeedlebrook always delivered a good audience, Illusian, the company's owner and sole dramaturg, explained once more. He staggered around, drunk on his own accolades - as well as the wine Parr had grifted from the locals.\n\nThe night wore on, and the troupe had descended into bickering. Tria and Denji lambasted their playwright over the quality of his plots, which fell into a predictable structure: tragedy strikes maiden, death finds maiden, death takes maiden. Illusian argued that complicated plots detracted from a good death scene.\n\nMagga, the youngest of the bunch, agreed with Tria and Denji's diagnosis, but kept her mouth shut. Had she not stowed away in the wandering troupe's wagon, she would certainly be somewhere far more miserable. Luckily for her, the Mechanicals had recently lost several actors due to Illusian's insistence on complete artistic control. Because of his attitude - and obvious mediocrity - they were facing a drought of fresh faces. And so, the ''Orphellum Mechanicals'' agreed to contract Magga to die in all their dramatics for the foreseeable future. For which she had been grateful.\n\nIllusian was still smarting from Denji and Tria's words when he motioned to Parr, their wagoner, to stop and make camp. The inebriated auteur set out his bedroll in pride of place next to the wagon. He then threw the rest of the bedding into the long grass nearby.\n\n''&quot;Ungrateful players can sleep in the wilds&quot;'', Illusian spat, ''&quot;where they shall hopefully find their manners.&quot;''\n\nThe rest of the troupe built a fire and swapped stories. Denji and Tria had fallen asleep in each other's arms while whispering potential names for their unborn child into each other's ears. They had nattered on about the day the traveling company would stop in Jandelle, a town so perfect and peaceful they would set aside their vagabond ways to raise their child.\n\nMagga moved closer to the crackling fire so its pops and whistles would drown out the irksome affections of her traveling companions.\n\nBut sleep never came. Instead, Magga tossed and turned, thinking about the looks on the audience's faces as the coiled spurts of blood unfurled from her neckline. A pretty maiden struck dead by her own na\u00efvet\u00e9 was all the theatrical pomp Illusian could muster, but the crowd lusted after the gruesome fa\u00e7ade.\n\nEventually, she left her bedroll and set out into the woods to soothe her unsettled mind.\n\n[[File:Kindred The Wolf 1.png|center]]\n\nIn the dead of night, Magga came upon a low grassy mound with slabs of standing stone at its base. Although she could not read the inscriptions, her fingers traced the familiar etching of {{ci|Kindred}}'s twin masks. This was a place of the dead, a burial site built long ago.\n\nShe felt a chill on the back of her neck that compelled her to look up. She was not alone. Magga immediately understood what she saw, for she'd encountered a crude impersonation of them night after night. But poor Denji couldn't begin to instill the dread washing over Magga. Before her, perched on a weathered barrow-archway, was {{ci|Lamb}} herself, flanked by her ever-faithful counterpart, {{ci|Wolf}}.\n\n''&quot;I hear a beating heart!&quot;'' said Wolf, his black eyes twinkling with delight. ''&quot;May I have it?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Perhaps&quot;'', replied Lamb. ''&quot;I sense she is afraid. Speak, beautiful one. Tell us your name.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I-I would have yours first&quot;'', stammered Magga, stepping backward. Her slow escape was halted by the speedy Wolf, who materialized unsettlingly close behind her.\n\nHe spoke directly in her ear. ''&quot;We have many names.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;In the West, I am Ina to his Ani&quot;'', said Lamb. ''&quot;In the East, Farya to his Wolyo. But we are Kindred everywhere. I am always Lamb to Wolf, and he is always Wolf to Lamb.&quot;''\n\nWolf reared up and sniffed at the air.\n\n''&quot;She is playing a boring game&quot;'' said Wolf. ''&quot;Let us play a new game, one of chasing and running and biting.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;She is not playing, dear Wolf&quot;'', said the Lamb. ''&quot;She is frightened and has lost her own name. It hides behind her lips, afraid to come out. Worry not, dear child, I have found your name. We know it as you know us, Magga.&quot;''\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 2.png|center|800px]]\n\n''&quot;P-please&quot;'', Magga stammered. ''&quot;Tonight is not a very good night for---&quot;''\n\nWolf's great pink tongue lolled out of the side of his mouth, and he proceeded to cackle.\n\n''&quot;All nights are good nights for pouncing&quot;'', said Wolf, laughing.\n\n''&quot;All days are, too&quot;'', Lamb said. ''&quot;With light comes a clear shot.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There is no moon tonight!&quot;'' cried Magga. She used what Illusian had taught her - to gesture grand, so those in the back could see her movements. ''&quot;It is hidden by a blanket of clouds, tucked away from my eyes and yours. Without the moon, what would be the last thing I would see?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We see the moon&quot;'', replied Lamb, as she caressed her fabled bow. ''&quot;It is always there.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There are no stars!&quot;'' said Magga, trying again, this time gesturing smaller and speaking quieter. ''&quot;No menagerie of twinkling diamonds, glittering in the midnight hue. What more beautiful view could one hope for whence one meets Lamb and Wolf?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This Magga-thing is playing a new game&quot;'', growled Wolf. ''&quot;It is called 'stalling'.&quot;''\n\nWolf stopped moving and cocked his head to the side. He turned his sideways snout toward Magga before speaking. ''&quot;Can we play 'Chasing the Magga-Thing and Bite Her to Bits?'?&quot;'' Wolf clacked his fangs together loudly for effect.\n\n''&quot;Let us ask her&quot;'', said Lamb. ''&quot;Magga! Do you prefer Wolf's {{ai|Wolf's Frenzy|Kindred|chase}}, or my {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|arrow}}?&quot;''\n\nMagga was trembling now. Her eyes raced to take in every last detail of the world around her. It wasn't such a bad place to depart. There was grass. There were trees. There was the ancient archway. There was stillness to the air.\n\n''&quot;I would prefer Lamb's arrow&quot;'', she said, looking at the rough crusts of bark on the trees. ''&quot;I'll imagine myself climbing to the highest boughs, like when I was a child. Only this time, I will never stop climbing. Is that what it is like to go with you?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Lamb, ''&quot;though it is a nice thought. Fear not, little maiden, we are just having our fun. You have come to us tonight; we have not come for you.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I cannot chase Magga-thing&quot;'', said Wolf, with a hint of disappointment in his voice. ''&quot;But there are other things nearby. Other things ripe for the chasing and the biting. Hurry, Lamb. I am hungry.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;For now, know that your theatrics have pleased us, and we will watch them until the day we meet again.&quot;''\n\nWolf passed over Magga and disappeared into the woods. The shadowy beast snaked away through fields of tall grass. Magga looked back toward the weathered barrow. Lamb was gone.\n\nThe actress fled.\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 3.png|center|800px]]\n\nWhen Magga returned to the encampment, she found it in utter ruin. The wagon she had only just begun to call home had been ransacked and reduced to a smoldering husk. Bits of clothing and ruined props lay strewn across the campsite.\n\nShe found Denji's body near where he'd slept. He had died protecting Tria, whose corpse lay behind him. Judging from the trails of blood, their deaths had not been slow. They had dragged themselves toward each other, their fingers entwined in one last caress before death.\n\nMagga noticed that Illusian had managed to kill two of the bandits before being burnt to a crisp along with Parr in the wagon.\n\nThe only thing that remained untouched were Denji's Lamb and Wolf masks. Magga picked them up and held them in her hands. She placed the Lamb mask over her own eyes and heard the voice of Wolf.\n\n''&quot;Chase the Magga-thing.&quot;''\n\nThe maiden ran the distance to Needlebrook, never once looking back.\n\n[[File:Kindred The Lamb 1.png|center]]\n\nThe Golden Round was filled to the brim with a sea of twinkling eyes, all glittering in excitement at the velvet curtain. The king sat in the theater with the queen and their advisers, all eagerly awaiting the onset of the dramatics. Everyone hushed as the black curtain lifted to reveal the actors.\n\nMagga sat in a quiet dressing room under the stage. She heard the crowd fall silent as she studied herself in the mirror. The luster of youth had faded from her eyes years ago, and left her with a long shock of silver running through her hair.\n\n''&quot;Madame!&quot;'' said the stagehand. ''&quot;You're not in costume yet.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No, child&quot;'', Magga said, ''&quot;I only dress at the last moment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is the last moment&quot;'', said the young stagehand, holding the two final pieces of Magga's costume: the same Lamb and Wolf masks from her days with the ''Orphellum Mechanicals''.\n\n''&quot;May your performance be blessed tonight&quot;'', the stagehand said.\n\nMagga prepared to leave for the stage. She slipped the masks over her head. The old chill from the dark barrow crept down her spine. She welcomed it - as always.\n\nShe enthralled the audience as she glided onto the stage, embodying Lamb's graceful movements. She thrilled the crowd with her rendition of Wolf's playful savagery. She, as the twin deaths personified, eased the suffering of her fellow actors, or ripped it from their throats, until the crowd stood on its feet and erupted in thunderous applause.\n\nIt was true.

He was twisted into a force of vengeance after {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|a magical cataclysm}} destroyed his home, surviving undeath only through the waters of life infused within his heartwood. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai now furiously battles to banish the scourge of unlife from the Shadow Isles and restore his home to its former beauty.\n\n==Lore==\nLong before living memory, a chain of islands erupted from deep beneath the ocean tides as blank slates of rock and clay. With its creation, the nature spirit Maokai was born. He took the form of a treant, with his tall body covered in bark and long limbs resembling branches. Maokai felt the profound loneliness of the land and its potential for teeming growth. He wandered from island to island in search of signs of life, growing ever more forlorn in his solitude.\n\nOn a hilly isle covered in soft, rich soil, Maokai sensed a boundless energy radiating from deep beneath the ground. He plunged his great roots downward until they reached a spring of magical, life-giving water and drank deeply. From this potent liquid, he grew hundreds of {{ai|Sapling Toss|Maokai|saplings}} and planted them across the islands.\n\nSoon the land was shawled with verdant forests, groves of towering virenpine, and tangled woods, all steeped in wondrous magic. Magnificent skytrees with expansive canopies and thickly winding roots covered the isles with lush green foliage. Nature spirits were drawn to the lavish vegetation, and animals reveled in the fertile greenery.\n\nWhen humans eventually came to the islands, they too thrived in the land's abundance and formed an enlightened society of scholars devoted to studying the world's mysteries. Though Maokai was wary of their presence, he saw how they respected the sanctity of the land. Sensing the deep magic within the woods, the humans built their homes in areas not heavily forested, to avoid disturbing any nature spirits. Maokai occasionally revealed himself directly to those he trusted and blessed them with knowledge of the verdant isles, even its greatest gift - the underground spring that could heal mortal wounds.\n\nCenturies passed, and Maokai lived in idyllic contentment until a fleet of soldiers from across the sea beached upon the shores of the isles. Maokai sensed something was terribly wrong. Their {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|grief-maddened king}} bore the corpse of his queen and in hopes of reviving her, bathed her decayed flesh in the healing waters. Reanimated as a rotting corpse, the queen begged to return to death. The king sought to reverse what he had done, unwittingly casting a terrible curse upon the land.\n\nFrom leagues away, Maokai felt the first ripples of the disaster that would soon devastate the isles. He sensed a horrific force gathering beneath the soil, and a bitter chill washed over him.\n\nAs the ruination spread, Maokai desperately plunged his roots deep into the ground and drank of the healing waters, saturating every fiber of his being with their magic. Before the cursed water reached him, Maokai withdrew his roots, severing all connection to the pool. He howled in rage as the sacred reservoir he had entrusted to men was fully corrupted - the spiraling coils churning underwater until nothing pure remained.\n\nMoments later, the mists surrounding the islands blackened and spread over the land, trapping all living things in an unnatural state between life and death. Maokai watched in helpless agony as all he knew - plants, nature spirits, animals, and humans alike - twisted into wretched shades. His fury grew; the great beauty he had cultivated from tiny saplings fell to ruin in an instant at the careless hand of man.\n\nThe enervating mist coiled around Maokai, and he wept as the bright flowers adorning his shoulders crumbled and fell to dust. His body shuddered and contorted into a mass of gnarled roots and tangled branches as the mist leached life from him. But Maokai's heartwood was saturated with the precious waters of life, saving him from the terrible fate of undeath.\n\nAs grotesque wraiths and horrific abominations flooded the land, Maokai was overcome by a host of lifeless men. He struck the spirits with {{ai|Sap Magic|Maokai|his branchlike limbs}} in manic violence, realizing the force of his blows could shatter them to dust. Maokai shuddered with revulsion: he had never killed before. He flew at the breathless shapes in a frenzy, but hundreds more overwhelmed him, and eventually he was forced to retreat.\n\nWith his home all but decimated and his companions turned to deathless horrors, Maokai was tempted to try and escape the nightmare of the isles. But from deep within his twisted form, he felt the sacred waters giving him life. He had survived the Ruination by carrying the very heart of the islands within him, and he would not abandon his home now. As the Blessed Isles' first nature spirit, he would remain and fight for the soul of the land.\n\nThough surrounded by endless hosts of malicious foes and darkening mist, Maokai fights with furious vengeance to conquer the evil that plagues the isles. His only pleasure comes from dealing savage violence to the soulless wraiths who roam his land.\n\nSome days, Maokai subdues the mist and its deathless spirits, breaking their hold on a grove of trees or a small thicket. Though new life has not bloomed in such cursed soil for an age, Maokai strives to carve havens, however temporary, free from regret and decay.\n\nSo long as Maokai continues to fight, hope remains, for steeped within his heartwood are the uncorrupted waters of life, the last remaining chance of restoring the isles. If the land returns to its joyous state, Maokai, too, will shed his twisted form. The nature spirit brought life to these isles long ago, and he refuses to rest until the isles bloom once more.\n\n;Nightbloom\nThe chill wind whips through cracks in my bark with a hollow whistling sound. I shiver. My limbs have long forgotten the warmth of summer.\n\nThe towering shapes around me fracture and fall in the gale. The lives within died long ago; now they are my silent companions. Their brittle trunks remain only as empty husks, rough gray sketches of the lush forest that once bloomed here.\n\nA spirit weaves between the trees in front of me, pale and spectral against the night air. A knot tightens in my bark. Normally I would lash my roots through its heart, but today I hold still, trying not to alert the wraith to my presence. I am tired of resisting. That I exist at all is an act of defiance against the curse plaguing these lands.\n\nIts moonlike eyes are vacant. There is nothing alive and vulnerable to fuel its cold bitterness on this isle of death, nothing to be hunted or consumed. The spirit slips between the trees, leaving me to my solitude.\n\nI look across the forest of shadows and my branches waver. My gaze catches a tiny flame of red growing amid the endless gray. Nestled in a mound of black dirt, the smallest flower bud pushes up from the ground, its petals so bright they burn my eyes.\n\nIt is a nightbloom. Long ago, they carpeted the floor of the Blessed Isles, blossoming on the evening of the summer solstice. By morning the flowers wilted, leaving only blackened petals, not to be seen again until the following year. But for one night, they illuminated the forest with blazing crimson, as if the very ground was aflame.\n\nI look around and, for a fleeting moment, hope that if one flower exists there might be others. But there is only the somber gray of these dead isles.\n\nMy boughs creak as I take a shaky step forward. I approach the bloom, transfixed, crushing ashen leaves to dust underfoot. My colossal frame towers over its delicate shape. I lean down until my face is inches above the sweet-scented petals. The potent groundwater within my heartwood stirs, awakening in recognition. ''Life.''\n\nThe flower's neck is tilted as if curious. Deep vermillion veins spread across each petal, and its pale green stem is coated with hundreds of silvery, velvet-soft hairs. I could spend eternity basking in its every facet.\n\nEvery moment it grows and shifts in subtle ways; its stem pushing ever higher while its petals slowly unfurl. I am enchanted by each movement, however minute. I watch as the bloom spreads to reveal the filaments extending from within, its heady scent flooding my mind with color. For a moment I forget the cold, the hollow wind, and my own bitterness.\n\nA pale light flickers and I flinch. A glowing shape approaches. My bark tingles. Nothing from these bloodless woods is an ally.\n\nThe cursed spirit is returning, attracted to the lure of movement. Life is not so still as death.\n\nI flex my limbs in fury, no longer eluding violence. I welcome it.\n\nFor one night, a living thing will exist on these barren isles unmarred by corrupt forces.\n\nThe specter races toward the flower and tries to inhale its fragile life. Before the bloom withers into a lifeless shade, I fling {{ai|Sap Magic|Maokai|my limbs}} forward and lash them about the spirit's legs. She screeches, recoiling as if burned, and I roar. The groundwater within me is anathema to such unnatural beings.\n\nShe twists and breaks free of my grasp. I hoist my roots and smash them to the ground. The impact splits the barren topsoil and sends {{ai|Arcane Smash|Maokai|shockwaves}} through the earth. The reverberations strike the wraith and she reels in agony. I laugh bitterly. As she stirs, I sling my limbs through her form and she dissolves.\n\nDusky mist rises from the ground, accompanied by a foul stench. As the wind moans, dozens of spirits materialize before me, their garish faces gaping silently at the scene before them. The nightbloom and I grow before the wall of shadows. I will not let them destroy this one pure thing amongst so much darkness.\n\nI throw all my rage into my blows, driving them back with furious strength. I cannot destroy every spirit on the isles, but I can hold them off for a time. A wraith tries to dart past me. I howl as I lift my roots to pierce its heart, and it dissipates into mist.\n\nMy strength is draining with so many spirits nearby, but I refuse to concede.\n\nThe flower grows brightly beneath the moonlight, oblivious to this battle for its very existence. A single crimson petal falls from its perfect blossom like a drop of blood. The lifecycle of the bloom is near its end, bringing death, and with it, respite. But I do not crave it. I feel I could cleanse the entire island of its scourge in my fury.\n\nThe cursed mist has risen above the treeline and swirls in great clouds. An endless host of spirits pours from the fog, mouths agape with ghoulish hunger. I rise to my greatest height and slam my limbs into the ravenous spirits, shattering one after another into dust. Still, more come.\n\nI howl as I stir the air into a crudely {{ai|Vengeful Maelstrom|Maokai|twisting spiral}}, and nourish the storm with my wrath until it expands in a tempestuous whirlwind. I revel in the chaos as the maelstrom surges in a frenzied circle around me and the flower. It blasts the spirits violently back beyond the trees. From within this nightmare, I have carved a sanctuary where life can grow.\n\nI turn to the flower. We are silent together at the eye of the storm, still amidst the madness. A second fiery petal falls from the nightbloom, then another. My energy drains into the maelstrom, but I do not falter and the tempest rages on. With each passing moment, the blossom droops further until it faces the ground. It is perfect in its slow, natural decay. I cannot look away as it gradually loses its crown of flaming petals and wilts completely.\n\nIt is dead.\n\nI lower my branches and the maelstrom quiets. Above me, the sky is slate gray - as bright as it ever gets in this grim place. The gloom of the mist encroaches once more and the spirits return. Their faces are blank, no longer sensing the illicit life of the nightbloom, no longer anticipating the joy of a fresh kill.\n\nThey retreat into the hollow woods. I whip my roots through a specter as it passes me, scattering its essence into the fading mist. The others edge farther away from me as they return to their gloom.\n\nThough the land appears unchanged, these isles are not the same gray wasteland they were yesterday. The waters of life stir within me and the soil beneath my roots is fertile again.\n\nThough its petals decay into dust, the luminous nightbloom burns fire-bright in my mind, igniting my fury. Just as these islands were born of burning rock, I will cleanse them of their pestilence in a flaming blaze.\n\nI follow the trailing spirits as they slip between hollow trees.\n\nThey will pay for their wickedness.\n\n", "id": 57}, "Thresh": {"key": "Thresh", "name": "Thresh", "title": "the Chain Warden", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Thresh\n|alias = \n* The Chain Warden\n* &lt;s&gt;Brother Thresh&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Flay|Thresh|Scythe}}\n* {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh|Soul Lantern}}\n|render = Thresh Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Specter &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Blessed Isles\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Soul Jailer\n* &lt;s&gt;Monk of Dusk&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;Artifacts Guardian&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Mordekaiser, Hecarim, Karthus\n|enemies = Lucian, Yorick\n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/thresh?_k=v00djy Chain Warden]\n* [[Shadow and Fortune]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The mind is a wondrous thing to tear apart.&quot;'' - {{ci|Thresh}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSadistic and cunning, Thresh is a restless spirit who prides himself on tormenting mortals and breaking them with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond the point of death, for Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his lantern to torture for all eternity.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nIn an age history has all but forgotten, the man who would later be known as Thresh was once a member of an order devoted to gathering and protecting knowledge. The masters of this order tasked him with guarding a hidden underground vault filled with dangerous and corrupted magical artifacts. Thresh was incredibly strong-willed and methodical, which made him well-suited to such work.\n\nThe vault Thresh guarded was buried deep beneath the citadel at the center of an island chain and protected by runic sigils, arcane locks and potent wards. Spending such time in the presence of dark spells began to affect Thresh as the magic sought out his innate malice. For years the relics preyed on his insecurities, taunting him with his deepest fears and feeding his bitterness.\n\nThresh\u2019s spite surfaced through wanton acts of cruelty, as his talent for exploiting vulnerability bloomed. He slowly tore pages out of a living book, binding it back together when it was all but spent. He scratched the glass of a mirror bound with the memory of an ancient mage until it was opaque, trapping the man in darkness, only to polish it anew and repeat. Just as a secret wants to be told, a spell wants nothing more than to be cast, and Thresh denied this each day. He would start to recite an incantation, then let the words trickle off his tongue, halting just before the last syllable.\n\nHe became exquisitely skilled at covering all evidence of his cruelty, such that no one in the order suspected he was anything other than a disciplined guard. The vault had grown so vast that no one knew its contents as completely as Thresh, and the lesser artifacts faded from the order\u2019s memory, as did Thresh himself.\n\nHe resented that he had to hide his meticulous work. Everything under his watch was evil, or corrupted in some way - why shouldn\u2019t he be free to do as he would?\n\nThe vault held many peculiar magical artifacts but no people, until one day when a chained man was dragged into the sunken catacombs. He was a warlock who had infused his body with raw sorcery, which gave him the power to regenerate his flesh, no matter how grievous the wound.\n\nThresh was delighted at his new ward - a being who could feel the full range of human suffering, but would not perish, a plaything he could torment for years to come. He started methodically separating the warlock\u2019s skin from his flesh with a hook, and used his chains to lash and tear the open wound until it healed. He took to wearing the chains as he patrolled the vault, reveling in the warlock\u2019s fear at the long, dragging sound of his approach.\n\nWith ample charges to torment in the vault, Thresh became even more distanced from the order above. He began to take his meals in his underground chamber lit by a single lantern, rarely emerging from the catacombs. His skin developed a pallid complexion from lack of sunlight, and his face became gaunt and hollow. Members of the order avoided him, and when a series of mysterious disappearances plagued the order, none thought to investigate Thresh\u2019s lair.\n\nWhen the disaster known as the Ruination struck, magical shockwaves claimed the lives of all who lived on the isles and transformed them into a state of undeath. While others screamed in anguish, Thresh reveled in the ruin. He rose from this cataclysm as a spectral abomination, but unlike many who have passed into the shadow world, Thresh did not lose his identity. Rather, his penchant for cruel torture and ability to discern weakness was only heightened.\n\nHe relished the chance to continue his cruelty without fear of reprisal, unfettered by the limits of mortality. As a wraith, Thresh could torment the living and the dead endlessly, delighting in their despair before claiming their soul for an eternity of suffering.\n\nThresh now seeks only particular victims: the most clever and resilient, and those with a strong will. His greatest joy comes from tormenting his victims until they lose any last glimmer of hope, before facing the inevitable hook of his chains.\n\n", "id": 412}, "Kayle": {"key": "Kayle", "name": "Kayle", "title": "The Judicator", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kayle\n|alias = The Judicator\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|Holy Sword}}\n* {{ai|Intervention|Kayle|Holy Magic}}\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nKayle Render.png|Masked\nKayle Unmasked Render.png|Unmasked\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Angel\n|birthplace = \n|residence = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Galio\n|rivals = Morgana\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;In [[the League of Legends]], Justice comes on swift wings.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIn a world far away where an ancient war still rages, {{ci|Kayle}} was a great heroine - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found.\n\nFor ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly for her people, wielding {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|her flaming sword}} forged before time itself.

There he endured the harshest training imaginable, a punishing regime that schooled him to be a formidable warrior.\n\nAs Hecarim grew to manhood, he mastered every form of combat and war-stratagem with ease. He quickly outstripped his fellow squires in mounted warfare, and the Knight Commander of the Iron Order saw greatness within the young man and recognized a potential successor. But as the years passed and Hecarim won victory after victory from the back of his mighty warhorse, the Knight Commander finally recognized a growing darkness within his lieutenant. Hecarim's thirst for wholesale slaughter and obsessive hunger for glory was eroding his honor and the Knight Commander knew the young knight must never become the master of the Iron Order. In his private chambers, he told Hecarim that he would not be his successor and though his lieutenant was furious, he bit back on his anger and returned to his duties.\n\nWhen the Order next rode to war, the Knight Commander found himself surrounded by enemies and isolated from his fellow knights. Only Hecarim could ride to his aid, but in a moment of rancor, he turned his mount away and left the Knight Commander to die. At battle's end, the surviving knights, oblivious to what Hecarim had done, knelt on the bloody ground and swore to follow him as their master.\n\nHecarim rode to the capital, and met with {{ci|Kalista}}, the king's general. Kalista recognized his exceptional nature, and when the king's wife was wounded by the poisoned blade of an assassin, she tasked the Iron Order with staying at the king's side while she sought a cure. Hecarim accepted, but being given what he perceived to be a menial task planted a seed of resentment.\n\nHecarim remained with the king as he descended into grief-induced madness. Gripped by paranoia, the king raged at those who sought to separate him from his dying wife and despatched the Iron Order to quell what he saw as dissent throughout his kingdom. Hecarim led the Iron Order in bloody suppressions of discontent, earning a dreadful reputation as a ruthless enforcer of the king's will. Villages burned and the riders of the Iron Order put hundreds to the sword. The kingdom was in darkness, and when the queen died, Hecarim spun falsehoods around the king, speaking of how he had uncovered the truth behind her death, seeking sanction to lead the Iron Order to foreign lands and earn yet more dark renown.\n\nBefore he rode out, Kalista returned from her quest. She had found a cure for the queen's malady upon the legendary Blessed Isles, but was too late to save her. Horrified at what had become of the kingdom, Kalista refused to share what she had discovered and was imprisoned for her defiance.\n\nHecarim saw an opportunity to win yet more favor and visited Kalista's cell. Promising to keep the king from any rash actions, Hecarim persuaded Kalista to reveal what she knew. Kalista reluctantly agreed and guided the king's fleet through the glamours veiling the Blessed Isles from sight.\n\nHecarim led the ruined form of the king to the center of the magical island, where he met with its guardians and demanded their aid. The guardians offered their sympathies, but told the king his wife was beyond their help. Enraged, the king ordered Kalista to kill the guardians one by one until they relented. Kalista refused and stood between the king and the island's inhabitants. Hecarim recognized a crossroads in his life and made a decision that would damn him for eternity. Instead of supporting Kalista, he drove {{ii|The Black Spear|a spear}} through her back and commanded the Iron Order to slay the inhabitants of the Blessed Isles. Hecarim and his warriors slaughtered the guardians until {{ci|Thresh|a lantern-bearing wretch}} finally led the king to what he sought - the secret to resurrecting his wife.\n\nBut when the queen returned to life she was a horror of decayed meat and maggot-ridden flesh who begged to be allowed to die once more. Repulsed at what he had done to his beloved wife, the king enacted a spell to end their lives and bind them together for all eternity. His conjuration was successful, but unwittingly empowered by the many potent magical artifacts stored on the island, its power was increased a hundredfold.\n\n[[The Black Mist|A hurricane of black mist]] surrounded the king, spreading across the island and killing everything it touched. Hecarim abandoned the king to his doom and led the Iron Order back to their ships, killing all in their path as the spirits of those slain by the black mist arose as undying wraiths. One-by-one, the knights were dragged down into undeath until only Hecarim remained. As uncontrolled sorcery filled him, he and his mighty steed were fused together in a monstrous abomination that reflected the true darkness of his soul.\n\nHowling in rage, the titanic beast known as the Shadow of War was wrought in an agonizing transformation, a brazen monster of fury and spite. The sins of his former life were heightened by the maelstrom of dark magic, birthing a creature of endless malice and terrifying power.\n\nNow Hecarim is bound to the Shadow Isles, patrolling its nightmare shores and killing all before him in a mockery of his former duty. And when the Black Mist reaches beyond the Shadow Isles, he and {{ai|Onslaught of Shadows|Hecarim|the spectral host}} of the Iron Order ride with him to slaughter the living in the memory of glories long passed.\n\n;No One Lives\nIcy waves crashed on the bleak shore, red with the blood of the men Hecarim had already butchered. The mortals he had yet to kill were retreating over the beach in terror. Black rain doused them and storm clouds boiled in from the mourning heart of the island. He heard them shouting to one another. The words were a guttural battle-chant he did not recognize, but the meaning was clear; they actually thought they might live to reach their ship. True, they had some skill. They moved as one, wooden shields interlocked. But they were mortal and Hecarim savored the meat-stink of their fear. He circled them, threading crumbling ruins and unseen in the shadowed mist rising from the ashen sand. The echoing thunder of {{ai|Warpath|Hecarim|his hooves}} struck sparks from black rocks. It gnawed at their courage. He watched the mortals through the slitted visor of his helm. The weak light of their wretched spirits was flickering corposant in their flesh. It repulsed him even as he craved it.\n\n''&quot;No-one lives&quot;'', he said.\n\nHis voice was muffled by the dread iron of his helm, like the corpse-rasp of a hanged man. The sound scraped along their nerves like rusted blades. He drank in their terror and grinned as one man threw down his shield and ran for the ship in desperation.\n\nHe bellowed as {{ai|Devastating Charge|Hecarim|he galloped}} from the weed-choked ruins, lowering {{ai|Rampage|Hecarim|his hooked glaive}} and feeling the old thrill of the charge. A memory flickered, riding at the head of a silver host. Winning glory and honor. The memory faded as the man reached the dark surf of cold breakers and looked over his shoulder.\n\n''&quot;Please! No!&quot;'' he cried.\n\nHecarim split him from collarbone to pelvis in one thunderous blow.\n\nHis ebon-bladed glaive pulsed as it bathed in blood. The fragile wisp of the man's spirit sought to fly free, but the mist's hunger would not be cheated. Hecarim watched as the soul was twisted into a dark reflection of the man's life.\n\nHecarim drew the power of the island to him and the bloody surf churned with motion as {{ai|Onslaught of Shadows|Hecarim|a host of dark knights}} wreathed in shimmering light rose from the water. Sealed within archaic plates of ghostly iron, they drew black swords that glimmered with dark radiance. He should know these men. They had served him once and served him still, but he had no memory of them. He turned back towards the mortals on the beach. He parted the mists, reveling in their terror as they saw him clearly for the first time.\n\nHis colossal form was a nightmarish hybrid of man and horse, a chimeric juggernaut of brazen iron. The plates of his body were dark and stamped with etchings whose meanings he only vaguely recalled. Bale-fire smouldered behind his visor, the spirit within cold and dead yet hatefully vital.\n\nHecarim reared as forking traceries of lightning split the sky. He lowered his glaive and led his knights in the charge, throwing up giant clumps of blood-sodden sand and bone fragments as he went. The mortals screamed and brought up their shields, but the ghost-knights charge was unstoppable. Hecarim struck first as was his right as their master, and the thunderous impact splintered the shield wall wide open. Men were trampled to bloody gruel beneath his iron-shod bulk. His glaive struck out left and right, killing with every strike. The ghost knights crushed all before them, slaughtering the living in a fury of thrashing hooves, stabbing lances and chopping blades. Bones cracked and blood sprayed as mortal spirits fled broken bodies, already trapped between life and death by the fell magic of {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|the Ruined King}}.\n\nThe spirits of the dead circled Hecarim, beholden to him as their killer and he reveled in the surging joy of battle. He ignored the wailing spirits. He had no interest in enslaving them. Leave such petty cruelties to {{ci|Thresh|the Chain Warden}}.\n\nAll Hecarim cared for was killing.\n\n", "id": 120}, "Khazix": {"key": "Khazix", "name": "Kha'Zix", "title": "the Voidreaver", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kha'Zix\n|alias = The Voidreaver\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Taste Their Fear|Kha'Zix|Claws}}\n* {{ai|Void Spike|Kha'Zix|Spikes}}\n* {{ai|Void Assault|Kha'Zix|Camouflage}}\n|render = Kha'Zix Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[The Void|Voidborn]] &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = Predator\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Kog'Maw, Cho'Gath, Malzahar\n|rivals = Rengar\n|related = [[The Hunt is On!]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Kill.

By his teenage years, his parents were nowhere to be found. By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.\n\nDr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer, an accomplishment that [[Noxus]] noticed. The empire was impressed by his ambition, and recruited his talents to initiate a relationship between the two nations.\n\nHe continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking.

A strong leader torn between tradition and revolution, Karma seeks to protect the peace of Ionia - by force if necessary.\n\nKarma once lived a tranquil life in a small Ionian village. Led by elder monks, the villagers practiced a tradition of benevolent magic and pacifism. Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\n\nHer inner peace was tested when the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded Ionia. While the village's elder monks insisted their peaceful ways would spare them from violence, Karma had heard enough tales of Noxian cruelty to openly question the elders' wisdom. Stern and unmoving, they told her to trust in tradition.\n\nWhen the invaders marched on the village, the elder monks rode out to negotiate a bloodless end to the battle. The Noxian general was offended by their show of weakness and slaughtered the monks himself as he ordered his soldiers to strike the village.\n\nAs the Noxians advanced, the villagers prepared to accept death, bound to their peaceful vows. But Karma would not accept death and instead saw another way: sacrificing a single life to spare many others.\n\nTo save her people, she drew upon {{ai|Mantra|Karma|the power within}} and summoned the full force of her will. {{ai|Soulflare|Karma|A burst of spirit fire}} emerged from her body and spiraled towards the Noxian general.\n\nThe flame took the form of {{ai|Gathering Fire|Karma|twin dragons}}, the symbol of Ionia itself. It was the first time Karma had ever used her powers to harm instead of protect, and neither she nor the villagers had ever seen anything like it.\n\nWhen the magic subsided, the general had fallen before her and his soldiers had scattered. The opposing forces surrendered to Karma's strength leaving her people, and their traditions, untouched.\n\nWhile the war raged on, Karma became a formidable leader of the Ionian resistance, but the conflict did not end when Noxus' armies fled the Ionian shores.\n\nIonia became divided between the resistance fighters who craved vengeance and the monks who demanded a return to spiritual tradition. Karma saw a third path, one that combined the strength Ionia found in war with the peaceful traditions the nation still held dear.\n\nShe now seeks to return her ravaged land to an enduring peace.\n\n", "id": 43}, "Annie": {"key": "Annie", "name": "Annie", "title": "the Dark Child", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Annie\n|real_name = Annie Hastur\n|alias = The Dark Child\n|weapon_pet = {{moi|Tibbers}}\n|render = Annie Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|residence = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* The Grey Order\n|allies = \n|friends = Amumu\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "here have always been those within [[Noxus]] who did not agree with the evils perpetrated by the [[Noxian]] High Command.

Both a warrior and a mystic, Volibear seeks to defend the ancient ways and the warrior spirit of his tribe.\n\nThough history recorded their once legendary feats in battle, the Ursine now lived in tranquil seclusion. The warriors were headed by a triumvirate of leaders who maintained a long-lived isolation, avoiding the petty affairs and conflicts of others. As shaman to the three, Volibear was a respected sage known for his insight. It was an era of unprecedented peace, but Volibear felt dread stirring within him. Prosperity was turning the tribe soft and weak, and many had long forgotten the sacred art of war. In time, Volibear felt the fire of their souls would be extinguished. When he revealed his misgivings to the triumvirate, they refused to listen and warned him to know his place.\n\nSeeking wisdom, Volibear undertook a perilous climb to the peak of the Ursine's sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. The eye of the storm was said to bestow portents, and legend held that the tempest would mark the next great chieftain of the tribe. As Volibear ascended the peak, he was struck by an unnatural bolt of lightning. When the shaman awoke, he was possessed by a horrific vision of the Freljord utterly consumed by darkness. Volibear saw an unprepared and complacent Ursine force slaughtered by [[Watcher|terrible creatures of ice]]. In an instant, he knew his race would perish if they did not prepare for war.\n\nVolibear rushed down the mountainside to recount what he had seen, but found the path blocked by three Ursine - the triumvirate. Knowing he would end the lasting peace, they refused to heed Volibear's warning and demanded his silence, by his word - or his death. Resolute and adamant, Volibear swore that the Ursine's very survival depended on his message, and launched into ferocious combat against the three. A terrible clash ensued, and just as Volibear succumbed to his opponents, he {{ai|Thunder Claws|Volibear|called upon}} the power of the maelstrom. Unleashing raw lightning, he struck the trio down with a thunderous blow. Stunned and astonished, the triumvirate beheld the sign of Ursine leadership: the force of the sacred storm.\n\nRecognizing his foretold ascendance, the triumvirate appointed Volibear as the Ursine's new leader. His influence was swift and decisive: he roused his tribe from complacency, revived their battle-hardened traditions, and allied with {{ci|Sejuani}}, the warrior who would fight with them against {{ci|Lissandra|the coming evil}}. With time, the tribe grew lean and fierce, becoming known again as fearsome warriors of legend.

He was an ideal pupil, intently absorbing the lessons of his father, and improving them with his uncanny feral instincts. Before his mane had fully grown, Rengar set off on his own and claimed a wide territory for himself. Along its perimeter, he mounted the skulls of his slain prey - a warning to would-be aggressors.\n\nHe thought undisputed reign of a region would fulfill him, but instead, he grew restless. No beasts in his domain proved challenging prey, and without formidable adversaries to push his limits, Rengar's spirit waned. He feared that no worthwhile game remained, that he would never again feel the {{ai|Thrill of the Hunt|Rengar}}. Just when things seemed their bleakest, he encountered the monster.\n\nIt was a disturbing, alien thing, distinctly out of place in [[Runeterra|his world]]. It bore {{ai|Taste Their Fear|Kha'Zix|huge scything claws}} and devoured any animal that strayed across its path. Overzealous at the prospect of a challenge, Rengar {{ai|Unseen Predator|Rengar|ambushed}} the monster in haste. It far outclassed anything he'd hunted before.\n\nTheir fight was savage, and each suffered crippling wounds. Rengar lost an eye, but the most grievous blow was to his pride. He had never before failed to make the kill. Worse yet, the severity of his injuries forced him to retreat.\n\nOver the following days, he hovered on the threshold between life and death. He was wracked with pain, but beneath it, he felt a glimmer of joy. [[The Hunt is On!|The hunt was on.]] If such powerful beings existed in the world, he would find them, and stack their heads high.\n\nThe monster, however, was a kill he wanted to savor.

Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes - fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these glyphs before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.\n\n==Lore==\nRyze was just {{csl|Ryze|Young|a young man}} when he first learned of the powerful arcane forces that lay hidden across the world. While on a diplomatic mission, Ryze overheard his master, Tyrus, in discussion with another wizened old mage. In hushed tones, they spoke of the potential danger of something called 'World Runes'. As Tyrus noticed his pupil, he abruptly ended the conversation, tightly clutching the scroll that never left his side.\n\nOver the following decades, knowledge of the Runes began to spread as more were unearthed. The world's brightest minds studied the ancient glyphs, attempting to determine the powers they possessed. Few could even begin to understand the importance of their origins, or the sheer power held within them. Some surmised that the Runes were integral to the creation of Runeterra itself. The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such 'Makers' Might' being used as a weapon.\n\nRyze and Tyrus traveled between various nations, trying to quell paranoia and encourage restraint, but their missions became increasingly precarious. Relentlessly, they strove to avert multiple disasters, but Ryze could sense his master's growing desperation.\n\nTyrus' worst fears were realized when he and his student were mediating a standoff between two warring nations, not far from Ryze's boyhood village of Khom. Each army accused the other of plotting to use runic weapons against the other, and each was prepared to do the same in self-defense. As tensions grew out of control, Tyrus could see it was a conflict he could not mediate. With the two sides determined to go to war, he could do nothing but flee with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nThey had escaped halfway across a mountain range before the battle erupted. Ryze suddenly felt the earth fall away beneath him. The ground seemed to retch and squeal, while the sky above them recoiled as if mortally wounded. Tyrus grabbed Ryze and screamed unheard commands, but the words were swallowed by the unnatural silence around them. For the first time, they were witnessing the effects of two World Runes at war.\n\nSeconds later, reality settled. Ryze and Tyrus clambered to the ruins of a nearby peak and looked back upon the valley where the two armies previously stood. Below, they saw insanity - destruction so massive that it defied all physical sense. The armies, the people, the very land itself were gone. An ocean that was previously beyond a day's journey was now rushing to meet them. Ryze could only fall to his knees and stare into the great hole left in the world. The devastation was complete. Nothing remained. Not even the village he once called home.\n\nOpen warfare raged across Runeterra. The first horrors of the Rune Wars sparked fear and aggression among those who now realized the power at their command. Even Ryze felt the urge to join the conflict to prevent further devastation of the kind unleashed on his people. Tyrus was there to stay the hand of his pupil, counseling that the path of vengeance would lead only to more heartache. Ryze was initially vexed by his master's words, but he soon came to accept Tyrus' wisdom.\n\nTraveling across the world to meet with those who held the Runes, Tyrus pleaded for sanity. To ensure the future of Runeterra, he asked that every World Rune be locked away beyond the reach of man. Deeply sobered by the imminent threat of annihilation, some agreed to turn over their World Runes to Tyrus, while others refused to cast aside their newfound power and influence.\n\nTyrus continued his work, attempting to remove all World Runes from the reach of humanity. Yet as hope for Runeterra grew, Tyrus seemed to unravel. Ryze saw his master grow more distant. While Tyrus dealt with the Runes, he began to send his student on missions that seemed to have little importance.\n\nRyze was on one such menial errand when he received word of a new cataclysm, this time to the southwest of [[Valoran]], in [[Icathia]]. The mage rushed to the scene of the devastation, beset with concern for his master and friend, hoping that he had survived. Upon his arrival, Ryze was elated to find that Tyrus was indeed safe. But Ryze's relief was short-lived. Next to the scroll he had never been allowed to read, sat two World Runes.\n\nThe older mage explained that once the World Runes were in play, he had no choice but to use them himself. Ryze was horrified as he realized Tyrus had not just survived the disaster, he had caused it. He continued his bitter tirade, telling his student that humanity was a reckless child, playing with power it did not understand. Tyrus could no longer play the role of diplomat for ignorant power-mongers. He had to stop them.\n\nThough Ryze tried to reason with Tyrus, it was no use. The infinitely wise paragon he'd looked up to since childhood was gone. Before him stood a flawed man, susceptible to the same temptations as the fools he decried. The Runes had corrupted him deeply, and he was sure to use them again and again, taking more of the world away each time.\n\nRyze had to act, even if it meant destroying his only true friend. He unleashed every ounce of {{ai|Overload|Ryze|arcane energy}} he could muster. Tyrus reached for the Runes, determined not to relinquish their power. In grasping for them, the corrupted mage had left himself momentarily defenseless to Ryze's onslaught. A moment later, Tyrus' corpse lay smoldering on the floor.\n\nRyze trembled with emotion as his mind struggled to process what he had done.\n\nAs he regained his senses, he found himself alone with the World Runes, their glow inviting him to possess them. Steeling himself, he picked up the strange symbols one by one, and immediately felt them transforming him into something greater, or more terrible, than he could ever otherwise be.\n\nShuddering, he dropped the Runes and backed away. If these glyphs could corrupt a mage with the strength and integrity of Tyrus, how was Ryze to handle them?\n\nHe then realized that if he walked away, someone else would find the Runes and use them. At that moment, Ryze understood the scale of his task. As long as any World Rune remained in play, the Rune Wars would continue and surely doom all Runeterra.\n\nUnsure what possible next step to take, Ryze saw the scroll Tyrus always carried with him. Tentatively, Ryze unfurled the scroll and was illuminated by a radiant glow. Suddenly, Ryze knew what he must do.\n\n[[File:Ryze_Runebody.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nEver since that day, Ryze has wandered the world, driven by the same unseen beckoning that both guides and terrifies him. He constantly rejects the promise of power within each Rune, choosing instead to bind them in secret locations {{ai|Realm Warp|Ryze|no one can access}}. He has spent centuries performing the task, his life abnormally prolonged by the magic he has absorbed carrying out his duty. Even after all this time, Ryze cannot afford to slow. The World Runes have begun to emerge once more, and the world has forgotten the price of wielding them.\n\n", "id": 13}, "Shen": {"key": "Shen", "name": "Shen", "title": "the Eye of Twilight", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shen\n|alias = \n* Eye of Twilight\n* Master Shen\n|weapon_pet = \n* Ionian Steel Saber\n* {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|Spirit Blade}}\n|render = Shen Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Eye of Twilight\n* Kinkou Leader\n* Material and Spirit World Avatar\n* &lt;small&gt;(Surgeon {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* [[Kinkou Order]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Kennen, Akali\n|rivals = Zed\n|enemies = Jhin\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The Eye is blind to fear, to hate, to love - to all things that would sway equilibrium.&quot;'' - {{ci|Shen}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLeader of a secret clan of mystic warriors, Shen serves as the Eye of Twilight, entrusted to enforce equilibrium in the world. Longing to remain free from the confusion of emotion, prejudice, or ego, Shen continually struggles, {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|spirit blade}} in hand, to walk the unseen path of dispassionate judgment.\n\n==Lore==\nAn enigma to the shadowy realm of the spirits, as well as the mortal territories of man, Shen belongs to neither. Within him exists an uneasy fusion of human soul and arcane power. He is seen by both sides as someone to be feared. He is immovable. He is constant. He answers to nothing but his purpose.\n\nAlthough his birth within the most revered of [[Ionia]]n clans marked him as destined to serve, it was his iron will that made Shen the chosen leader of [[Kinkou Order|a shadowed order]]. Wielding his {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|spirit blade}} \u2013 the symbol of his duty, as well as his connection to the spirit realm - Shen roams both worlds, unerringly drawn to any place where one side threatens to overwhelm the other.\n\nThere are countless legends recounting Shen's battles across the realms. From his innumerable clashes with the Seven Demon Clan throughout Ionia's physical and ethereal planes to Shen's brutal scourging of the loathsome skin devourers from the Black Steppes of the [[Freljord]], the truth is lost among the tales told in his wake.\n\nOne of the most fanciful stories recounted by Ionians is of the day Shen suddenly appeared in the central court of [[Noxus]]. Standing in the very heart of his enemy's stronghold, onlookers watched in rapt horror as he appeared to fight a terrible battle against a threat they could not see. To the crowd, Shen seemed to flash in and out of existence, wounds blossoming all over his body from nowhere. Unknown to the Noxians, he singlehandedly defended their entire empire from an incursion by the spirit world.\n\nThough Shen walks a lonely path on both this plane and beyond, he does not always walk alone. Other members of his hidden sect - the mortal shadow warrior, {{ci|Akali}}, and the lightning-quick [[yordle]], {{ci|Kennen}} - always stand ready to assist him.\n\nThough he has allies, Shen is solely entrusted with his father's blade and the responsibility it carries. The Eye of Twilight is forbidden from allowing passion to sway his judgement. While he still unswervingly executes his duty, Shen struggles to contain his anger over the murder of his father at the hands of {{ci|Zed}}, a man he once considered his brother.\n\nWith the fate of the world of men, as well as the spirit realm, resting on his shoulders, Shen struggles to maintain the balance between his human emotions and his spiritual focus. How long can one man balance two worlds on the edge of a blade?\n\n;True Neutral\n''&quot;It was no tempest. It was a spirit&quot;'', said the fisherman, still rattled by the shipwreck he'd barely survived two nights ago. The man told of his fishing vessel being sunk by a creature, large as a house and quick as the wind.\n\nShen listened to the tale, silently weighing the facts as presented.\n\n''&quot;Show me where it happened&quot;'', said Shen.\n\nThe man led him to a beach in the bay, where a team of villagers worked to recover the drowned bodies of the mariners. Shen knelt to examine a piece of wreckage. The gashes in the driftwood were deep and savage, the work of powerful claws.\n\n''&quot;How many dead?&quot;'' he asked. ''&quot;All but me... Six&quot;'', responded the fisherman.\n\n''The spirits are strong'', thought Shen, digging through the wreckage for any further evidence.\n\nAt last, on the edge of a splintered portion of the hull, he found it: a small tuft of gossamer hair. Most people would overlook it, or if they did see it, they'd never believe a creature that could break a ship in half could leave something so delicate. But Shen had seen hair like this before. Any doubts he'd had about the veracity of the fisherman's tale faded as he watched the fine, silvery tuft dissolve into nothing at his touch.\n\n''&quot;A demon&quot;'', Shen remarked. ''&quot;You must have sailed into its path.&quot;''\n\nThe fisherman nodded grimly. Spirits of all kinds were known to mingle with the physical world, especially in Ionia, where the barrier between realms was thin and passable. The ethereal and material planes were in constant contact, sliding peacefully past one another like oil atop water.\n\nAs the Eye of Twilight, it was Shen's duty to walk between the worlds, ensuring neither side overwhelmed the other. To humans, he was a ghost, vanishing in the space between breaths to reappear many miles away. To spirits, he was a human, flesh and bone who ought never to venture into ethereal realms.\n\nHe knelt on the beach to examine one of the corpses that had been recovered. The man had been torn in half, just below the ribs. What was left of his innards dangled from a pale, bloated torso.\n\n''&quot;You need not worry. I shall have the monster before nightfall&quot;'', said a voice from behind.\n\nShen turned to see a holy man sent by the local temple. Several acolytes stood around him, carrying an assortment of mystical trinkets and oils. They were beginning a cleansing ritual to root out any spiritual disturbances in the area. The holy man stared at Shen, as if sizing up his value.\n\n''&quot;Can we count on your help, sir?&quot;'' the man asked.\n\n''&quot;Balance will be restored&quot;'', said Shen with an assuring nod.\n\nHe parted ways with the holy man and continued to follow the faint trail of gossamer hair. He thought of the dead seafarers and the cost he'd need to exact from the demon. The words of his father still rang true: ''&quot;The hardest part is finding the point of balance in all things.&quot;'' True neutrality, the precise center of all forces at work in the world - that is what the Eye must be able to distinguish.\n\nEnforcing that equilibrium was its own struggle. For the task, Shen carried two blades on his back. One was an Ionian steel saber that could cleave through a person in one blow. The other was {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|a sword of pure arcane energy}}. It was used for dealing with spirits, and had been passed down through many generations of Shen's ancestors. He had slain countless demons, ghosts, wraiths, and sprites with it over the years, and fully expected to take one more before the day was done.\n\nAt last, Shen came to a secluded inlet, quiet and devoid of human activity. On a sandbar in the shallows lay the demon, its fine, glossy coat shimmering in the dusk. The creature swelled as it rested, engorged from consuming the mortal essences of its victims. Shen crept through the rushes, silently edging toward the sleeping demon. He could see its massive ribcage expand and contract with deep, restful breaths. When he was but a few paces from the sandbar, he drew his spirit blade, readying his strike.\n\nSuddenly, a distressing sound stayed his hand. It was a shrill, ghastly cry, emanating from the very air itself. It sounded familiar, but before Shen could identify the noise, he heard it again. And again. And again, culminating in a chorus of blood-curdling shrieks. These were the cries of dying spirits. Shen's eyes darted back to the demon, now beginning to stir from its slumber. Shen took one more look at his spirit blade, calmly weighing his options. He then clasped his hands together, carefully focusing his [[File:Stand United Shield.png|20px|link=]] ki, and disappeared in {{ai|Stand United|Shen|a vortex of crackling energy}}, leaving the demon alone on its sandbar.\n\nA moment later, Shen reappeared at the site of the shipwreck.  All around, smoldering pools of black ooze evaporated into the air, coupled with the lingering reek of terror.\n\nShen counted the dissipating black puddles, each the remains of a slain spirit. His tally was interrupted as the holy man entered the clearing with his acolytes. One of the men held a cord of flax and silver. Tethered to the other end was a smaller spirit - an imp of no significance. It struggled against the choke of its leash. It wailed as it saw the remains of its brethren.\n\n''&quot;Would you care to dispose of this one?&quot;'' the holy man asked Shen, casually, as if offering him a bowl of soup at dinner.\n\nShen looked at the sticky, smoldering pools that were mighty beings of the otherworld just moments ago. Then he turned his gaze toward the priest and the wailing imp.\n\n''&quot;I am sorry for this, Your Holiness&quot;'', he said. He placed his spirit blade back into its scabbard and drew his steel saber instead. It was not the sword he had expected to use that day.\n\n", "id": 98}, "Zac": {"key": "Zac", "name": "Zac", "title": "the Secret Weapon", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zac\n|alias      = * The Secret Weapon \n|render     = [[File:Zac Render.png|200px|link=]]\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race       = Artificial Lifeform\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence  = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = * [[Zaun]]ite Hero\n|friends    = Twitch\n|faction    = * [[Zaun]] &lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|related    = \n}}\n== Lore ==\n[[File:Zac_picture_1.png|thumb|left]]\nZac is the product of a [[Zaun]] experiment to manufacture a hexchem-engineered supersoldier \u2013 the Zaun Amorphous Combatant.

Though he was created inside a weapons laboratory, Zac was rescued and adopted by two loving parents who raised him to be a kind and friendly child. As the years passed, he grew up to be a fierce hero, sworn to protect the ordinary, everyday people of Zaun.\n\n", "background": "ong ago, two Zaun scientists developed an organic substance that could withstand extreme conditions, spontaneously alter its biological structure, and generate tremendous amounts of kinetic force. As the scientists, husband and wife, watched the prototype grow from a spoon-sized droplet to a small blob, they noticed that their creation would respond to their presence. It sprung forward when they called and bounced when they sang. The couple began to see more than an experiment; they saw a small child, filled with affection and joy.\n\nAfter testing the prototype one evening, the scientists placed the blob back in its cage. It slouched and shuddered in the corner, inconsolably sad. At that moment, the couple realized that their beloved creation wished for a free life outside the lab. They were struck by their conscience and could not allow the prototype to be used as a weapon. The husband and wife fled with the young blob, replacing its weapon designation \u2013 Zaun Amorphous Combatant \u2013 with a proper name: Zac. In a quiet neighborhood far from the cities of Zaun, the scientists raised Zac as their own child.\n\n[[File:Zac picture 2.png|thumb|150px]]\nZac was always different from the other children. None had his powers of strength and flexibility, so the couple taught him to tell right from wrong and to use his gifts responsibly.

Unable to replicate the formula used to create the amorphous prototype, the laboratory's staff never stopped searching for the scientists and their experiment. When they tracked down the family, they threatened to tear it apart. The staff abducted Zac's parents and demanded that the couple assist in his capture and return. Seized by the fear of losing his freedom and his parents, Zac unleashed every ounce of his raw energy and mass for the very first time. He subdued his parents' captors, sent the laboratory's workers fleeing, and brought his loved ones home. From then on, Zac vowed to defend all ordinary lives threatened by extraordinary treachery and wickedness.

When the unknowable structure of the universe is threatened, Bard steers all existence away from utter annihilation.\n \n==Lore==\n;Bard Mountain\n''[[Noxus|Noxian]] troops tried to capture Bard Mountain and obtain a Celestial artifact guarded by the [[Ionia]]ns of the floating villages. During the battle, the village sage rushed to take the artifact atop one of the Mountain Shrines, but Noxian arrows mortally wounded him before he could get there. As a last act of defiance, the sage used the artifact to strike his would-be killer, in the process obliterating him as well as slicing a nearby mountain in half, effectively failing in his duty to not use the artifact for destruction.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Ev3qQR4G-bard-qa?show=flat&amp;comment=015b0000 Celestial Artifact explained a bit]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n''This misuse of the egg-looking artifact's power drew a {{ci|Bard|Celestial}}'s attention, who promptly intervened by hurrying to the site, retrieving the artifact and evacuating it from the mortal plane before the Noxians and/or Ionians could use the egg for war. A constellation appeared in the night sky shortly after.''\n\n;The Wonder Above\n: ''An elderly Ionian (the child being carried by a relative by the end of 'Bard: Mountain' &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Ev3qQR4G-bard-qa?show=flat&amp;comment=00020000 Bard Mountain happening before Wonder Above]&lt;/ref&gt;) is sitting in front of a camp fire atop one of the Floating Villages' peaks, teaching three teens opposite to him the importance of storytelling and the meaning behind several constellations.''\n\nStories are not just history. They can be so much more. They nourish your mind and, if told well, can even fill your belly. Some tales are warnings, reaching across time. Others uplift our souls from the yoke of everyday burdens. We laugh at fools, cheer heroes, and curse villains until the fire burns down to embers.\n\nOur first rule: The facts may be important, but they aren't as vital as the telling, of speaking to who we are and why we live. Details might change and fade, but truth lives with us for all time.\n\nStories are everywhere. We build them from what we see. Even the sky above whispers to us.\n\n[[File:Bard lore 1.jpg|center|500px]]\n\nLook toward [[Watcher|the Frozen Watcher]].\n\nSummer's grip loosens; winter's herald dominates the night skies.\n\nA horde of these strange creatures once enslaved the tribes of the [[Freljord]].

Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the ancient empire of Shurima to greatness for many centuries. After the fall of the empire, he went into self-imposed exile, becoming little more than a legend. Now that the ancient city of Shurima has risen once more, he has returned, determined to ensure it never falls again.\n\n==Lore==\nNasus' brilliance was recognized from a young age, long before he was chosen to join the ranks of the Ascended. A voracious scholar, he read, memorized and critiqued the greatest works of history, philosophy, and rhetoric within the Library of the Sun before he'd seen ten summers. His passion for reading and critical thinking were not passed down to his younger brother {{ci|Renekton}}, who was quickly bored, and spent his time fighting with other local children. The brothers were close, and Nasus kept a protective eye over his younger brother, helping to ensure he didn't get into too much trouble. However, it wasn't long before Nasus was welcomed into the exclusive Collegium of the Sun, leaving home to take up his place in this prestigious academy.\n\nWhile the pursuit of knowledge would always be his passion, Nasus' grasp on military strategy and logistics ensured he became the youngest general in Shuriman history. While he was a competent soldier, his genius lay not in fighting battles, but in planning them.\n\nHis strategic foresight became legendary. In war, he was always a dozen moves ahead of the enemy, able to predict their movement and reactions, as well as pinpoint the exact moment to push the attack or pull back. A deeply empathetic man who took his responsibilities incredibly seriously, he always ensured his soldiers were well provisioned, paid on time, and treated fairly. Every loss of life pained him deeply, and he often refused to rest as he planned and replanned his troop movements and battle dispositions until they were perfect. He was loved and respected by all who served in his legions, and he guided the armies of Shurima to countless victories. His brother Renekton often served on the front lines of these wars, and the two of them quickly garnered an aura of invincibility.\n\nDespite the acclaim Nasus won, he did not enjoy war. Though he understood its importance - for now at least - in ensuring the continued progress of the empire, he firmly believed his greatest contribution to Shurima was in the knowledge he gathered for future generations.\n\nAt Nasus' urging, all the books, scrolls, teachings and histories of the cultures he defeated were preserved in great libraries and repositories throughout the empire, the greatest of which bore his name. His hunger for knowledge was not for selfish reasons, but to share wisdom with all of Shurima, to enhance understanding of the world and bring enlightenment to the empire.\n\nAfter decades of dutiful service, Nasus was cruelly struck down by a terrible wasting sickness. Some say he encountered {{ci|Amumu}}, a long-dead child-king said to bear {{ai|Cursed Touch|Amumu|a terrible curse}}; others believed he was laid low by the evil magicks of an [[Icathia]]n cult-leader. Whatever the truth, the emperor's own physician declared, with a heavy heart, that Nasus was incurable, and would be dead within a week.\n\nThe people of Shurima went into mourning, for Nasus was its brightest star and beloved by all. The emperor himself begged the priesthood for an augury. After a day and night of communing with the divine, the priests declared it the will of the sun-god that Nasus be blessed with the Ascension ritual.\n\nRenekton, now a great war-leader, raced back to the capital to be with his brother. The terrible sickness had advanced dramatically, and Nasus was little more than a skeleton, his flesh wasted away and his bones as fragile as glass. So weak was he that as the golden light from the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} streamed onto the Ascension dais, Nasus was unable to climb the final stairs and step into the light.\n\nRenekton's love for his brother was stronger than any sense of self-preservation, and he nobly bore Nasus onto the dais. Ignoring his brother's protests, he willingly accepted oblivion in order to save Nasus. However, Renekton was not destroyed, as was expected. When the light faded, two Ascended beings stood before Shurima. Both brothers had been deemed worthy, and the emperor himself dropped to his knees to give thanks to the divine.\n\nNasus was now a towering, jackal-headed being of great strength, his eyes glittering with fierce intelligence, while Renekton had been transformed into a heavily muscled behemoth bearing the likeness of a crocodile. They took their place alongside the other rare Ascended beings of Shurima, and became its protectors.\n\nWhile Renekton had always been a great warrior, now he was virtually unstoppable. Nasus too had been gifted with powers far beyond the understanding of mortal men. The greatest boon of his Ascension - his newly extended longevity, which allowed him countless lifetimes to spend in study and contemplation - would, after the fall of Shurima, also prove to be his curse.\n\nOne side-effect of the ritual that disturbed Nasus was the increased {{ai|Reign of Anger|Renekton|savagery}} he saw within his brother. At the culmination of the siege of Nashramae, which finally brought that ancient city under Shuriman rule, Nasus witnessed the victorious Shuriman soldiers butchering everyone they came across and setting the city ablaze. Renekton led the massacre, and it was he who set fire to the great library of Nashramae, destroying countless irreplaceable volumes before Nasus was able to contain it. This was the closest the brothers ever came to bloodshed, standing in the center of the city, weapons drawn against each other. Under the stern, disappointed gaze of his brother, Renekton's bloodlust waned, and he finally turned away in shame.\n\nOver the following centuries, Nasus bent his every effort to learning all he could, scouring the desert for years in search of ancient artifacts and wisdom, eventually going on to discover the legendary Tomb of the Emperors hidden beneath the Shuriman capital.\n\nNasus and Renekton had both been lured away when the Ascension ritual of Emperor {{ci|Azir}} went terribly wrong, the young emperor betrayed by his closest advisor, the magus {{ci|Xerath}}. The brothers returned as fast as they could, but were too late. Azir was dead, along with most of the capital's citizens. Filled with rage and grief, Nasus and Renekton battled the malevolent being of pure energy that Xerath had become.\n\nUnable to kill Xerath, they sought to bind him in {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|a magical sarcophagus}}, but even that was not enough to hold him. Renekton, perhaps attempting to atone for Nashramae years earlier, grabbed Xerath and bore him into the Tomb of the Emperors, bidding Nasus seal them in. Nasus refused, desperate to find another way, but there was no other option. With a heavy heart, he sealed Xerath and his brother within the fathomless darkness, locking them away for all eternity.\n\nThe Shuriman empire collapsed. Its great central city sank into ruin, and the holy {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} fell from the sky, drained of power by Xerath's magic. Without it, the divine waters flowing from the city ran dry, bringing death and famine to Shurima.\n\nBearing the heavy burden of guilt for having damned his brother to darkness, Nasus took to roaming the sands, accompanied only by the ghosts of the past and his grief. A melancholy figure, he stalked the now dead cities of Shurima, watching as they were slowly swallowed by the desert, lamenting the fallen empire and its lost people. He embraced isolation, a lean, solitary nomad who the occasional traveler claimed to glimpse before he disappeared into a sandstorm or an early morning haze. Few believed such stories, and Nasus became little more than a legend.\n\nCenturies passed, and Nasus all but forgot his old life and former purpose, until the moment when the now buried Tomb of the Emperors was rediscovered, and its seal broken. In that moment, he knew Xerath was free.\n\nAncient vigor stirred in his breast, and as Shurima rose from the sands, Nasus traversed the desert, angling toward the newly reborn city. Though he knew he had to battle Xerath once more, hope stirred within him for the first time in millennia. Not only was this potentially the dawn of a new Shuriman empire, but he dared believe it might also herald a long-awaited reunion with his beloved brother.\n\n;Ouroboros\n{{ci|Nasus}} walked at night, unwilling to face the sun. The boy followed in his wake.\n\n''How long had he been there?''\n\nThose mortals who caught a glimpse of the monstrous vagabond always ran, all save the boy. Together, they wove a path through the bygone tapestry of [[Shurima]]. Self-imposed isolation chipped at Nasus' consciousness. The desert wind howled around their malnourished frames.\n\n''&quot;Nasus, look, above the dune sea&quot;'', said the child.\n\nStars guided the pair's sojourn across the desiccated expanse. The old jackal no longer wore the armor of the [[Ascended]]. The golden monuments lay buried with the past. Now a hermit dressed in tattered fabric, Nasus scratched at his matted fur before slowly raising his head to observe the night sky.\n\n''&quot;The Piper&quot;'', said Nasus, his voice low and graveled. ''&quot;The season will change soon.&quot;''\n\nNasus put a hand on the boy's tiny shoulder and looked down into his sunburnt face. There, he saw the soft lines and curves of Shuriman lineage, worn ragged by travel.\n\n''When did it become your place to worry? Soon we will find you a home. Wandering between the ruins of an extinguished empire is no life for a child.''\n\nThis was the nature of the universe. Brief moments unfolded into the endless cycles of existence. The heady philosophy weighed upon him, but it was more than just another stone in his endless tally of self-imposed guilt. In truth, the boy would inevitably be changed if he was allowed to follow. Remorse darkened Nasus' brow like a thunderhead. Their companionship sated something deep within the ancient hero.\n\n''&quot;We can reach Astrologer's Tower before dawn. But we'll have to climb&quot;'', said the boy.\n\nThe tower was close. Nasus pulled himself up the cliff face hand over hand, the climb memorized to such perfection that he took great liberties with each handhold, tempting death. The boy clambered up by his side, his agile form utilizing every nook and cranny offered by the blemished rock.\n\n''What would happen to this innocent if I gave in to death?'' The thought troubled Nasus.\n\nWisps of fog rolled through the crags of the upper cliffs, each threading the narrow rocks like tiny mountain paths. The boy scurried over the top first. Nasus followed.\n\nIn the distance, metal clanged against stone, and voices could be heard through the haze - they spoke in a familiar dialect. Nasus was shaken from his reverie.\n\n''The well at Astrologer's Tower occasionally attracted nomads, but never this close to the equinox.'' The boy stood perfectly still, his fear palpable.\n\n''&quot;Where are the fires?&quot;'' asked the boy.\n\nA horse's whinny pierced the night.\n\n''&quot;Who goes there?&quot;'' asked the boy. The words rolled through the darkness.\n\nA lantern sparked to life, illuminating a band of riders. ''Mercenaries. Raiders.''\n\nThe jackal's eyes snapped wide.\n\nHe saw seven of them. Their curved blades remained sheathed, but the look in their eyes spoke of martial training and guile.\n\n''&quot;Where is the caretaker?&quot;'' asked Nasus.\n\n''&quot;He and his wife are asleep. The cool evening prompted them to retire early&quot;'', replied one of the riders.\n\n''&quot;Old jackal, my name is Malouf&quot;'', said another rider. ''&quot;We have been sent by the Emperor.&quot;''\n\nNasus stepped forward, betraying the briefest hint of anger.\n\n''&quot;Does he seek acknowledgement? Then let me give it. There is no emperor in this fallen age&quot;'', said Nasus.\n\nThe boy stepped forward defiantly. The dark messengers backed away from the lantern. Long shadows obscured defensive stances.\n\n''&quot;Deliver your message and leave&quot;'', said the child.\n\nMalouf dismounted and stepped forward. He reached a calloused hand into the folds of his shirt and produced a dark amulet bound to a thick, black chain. The geometry of the metal sparked recollections of magic and destruction in Nasus' mind.\n\n''&quot;Emperor {{ci|Xerath}} sends offerings. We are to be your servants. He welcomes you to his new capital at Nerimazeth.&quot;''\n\nThe mercenary's words fell on Nasus like a hammer on glass.\n\nThe boy promptly knelt and snatched up a weighty rock.\n\n''&quot;Die!&quot;'' cried the boy.\n\n''&quot;Take him!&quot;'' said Malouf.\n\nWith a heave, the boy hurled the rock through the air, its perfect arc threatening to shatter mercenary bone on impact.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Renekton}}, no!&quot;'' roared Nasus.\n\nThe riders abandoned their half-hearted deception. Nasus knew then that the caretaker and his wife were dead. Xerath's greeting would come in the form of cold steel. Truth began to eclipse illusion.\n\nNasus reached for the boy. The child tore into shadows of memory that dissipated across the starlit ground.\n\n''&quot;Goodbye, brother&quot;'', whispered Nasus.\n\nXerath's emissaries fanned out, their horses bucking and snorting. The Ascended was flanked on three sides. Malouf did not hesitate, drawing his blade and piercing Nasus' side with it. Pain rippled through the ancient curator's body. The rider attempted to withdraw his weapon, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. A clawed hand gripped the blade, keeping it agonizingly buried within Ascended flesh.\n\n''&quot;You should have left me to my ghosts&quot;'', said Nasus.\n\nNasus tore Malouf's sword from his hand, shattering fingers and tearing ligaments.\n\nThe demigod pounced on his attacker. Malouf's body cracked under the jackal's enormous weight.\n\nNasus leapt to the next rider, pulling him from his saddle; two strikes ruptured organs and stole the wind from his lungs. His broken form spun off into the sand, a ruined mass of agony. His horse reared and fled into the desert.\n\n''&quot;He's mad!&quot;'' said one of the riders.\n\n''&quot;Not any longer&quot;'', said Nasus, approaching the mercenary leader.\n\nA strange fragrance filled the air. Dead flowers spinning on lavender colored threads followed in his wake. Malouf twisted on the ground, the broken fingers of his right hand {{ai|Wither|Nasus|withered}}, skin sagging like wet parchment. The barrel of his chest caved in on itself like a rotting spine fruit.\n\nWhite-knuckled panic overtook the remaining mercenaries. They struggled to keep their mounts under control, if only to retreat. Malouf's body lay abandoned in the sand.\n\nNasus turned east toward the ruins of Nerimazeth.\n\n''&quot;Tell your 'emperor' his cycle nears its end.&quot;''\n\n&lt;gallery type = &quot;slideshow&quot; widths = &quot;640&quot; position = &quot;center&quot; crop = &quot;false&quot; hideaddbutton = &quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFall of the Empire 1.jpg\nFall of the Empire 2.jpg\nFall of the Empire 3.jpg\nFall of the Empire 4.jpg\nFall of the Empire 5.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "id": 75}, "TwistedFate": {"key": "TwistedFate", "name": "Twisted Fate", "title": "the Card Master", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Twisted Fate\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Loaded Dice|Twisted Fate}}\n* {{ai|Wild Cards|Twisted Fate}}\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nTwisted Fate Render.png|Current\nTwisted Fate Cutpurse Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = [[Serpentine River]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Card sharp\n* Thief\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Graves, Illaoi\n|rivals       = Evelynn \n|alias        = * The Card Master\n* Twisted Fate\n|real_name    = Tobias Foxtrot\n|related      = &lt;nowiki/&gt;\n*[http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_01#Evelynn:_The_Bachelormaker?

He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P1.png|thumb|left|150px]]\n\nBorn to the nomadic river-folk of the Serpentine, the boy was taught the magic of the cards at an early age and soon learned what it was to be hated. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange ways, the boy's people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders claimed this was the way of the world, but their refusal to fight back against this prejudice always rankled the young boy's sensibilities.\n\nWhen men who'd lost their fortunes in the gambling tents of the river folk returned in the dead of night to exact vengeance, they came bearing cudgels and emboldened by cheap rotgut. They beat the river folk back to their boats with curses and blows, eventually turning their weapons upon the boy's family. The boy could take no more and fought back, driving the men away with swift blows from their own clubs.\n\nProud of what he had done, the boy was stunned when his people turned their back on him. Retaliation went against the code of the river, and there could be only one punishment. Exile. His whole world falling apart around him, the boy watched helplessly as the barques of his folk sailed away without him, leaving him with nothing, alone for the first time in his life.\n\nThe boy grew to manhood drifting from town to town, trawling the gambling dens of every city he came to, using his preternatural skill at cards to earn coin to survive. That he was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus. Though always careful to let his opponents win at least some hands, he soon learned more ways to fight when many a disgruntled opponent sought to reclaim their lost fortunes.\n\nAcross one table, he met a fellow named Malcolm Graves and, recognizing a kindred soul, joined forces with him. The two spent years cutting a ruinous swathe across Valoran. With every con, swindle, and heist, he sought ever more dangerous means to make the cards bend to his will.\n\nThat search ended badly when a heist went wrong, resulting in Graves being taken alive, though the riverman ran free. The exact circumstances of that night and its dire consequences for both men remain shrouded in mystery, for the gambler never speaks of it. Seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the waters and took another: Twisted Fate.\n\nIn the time since, Twisted Fate has continued to ply his games of chance in the high parlors and low dens of every city he visits, earning countless fortunes along the way \u2013 though none can say what becomes of these winnings (other than his fine clothes) or why he seems driven to amass such wealth. He has been imprisoned with great fanfare on dozens of occasions, but there is no cell in Runeterra that has been able to hold him. Twisted Fate is always gone with morning's light, leaving only a mocking calling card to speak to his being there at all.\n\nIn Bilgewater, Twisted Fate and Graves finally had their day of reckoning. After a highly destructive running battle, and narrowly avoiding death at the hands of {{ci|Gangplank}}, the pair finally put aside their differences, and are now once again working together.\n\nNigh-on impossible to track, Twisted Fate has been said to vanish into thin air every time an enemy believes they have him cornered. A useful skill indeed for a man who has parted thousands of souls from their gold...\n\n''All eyes in Fortune's Glory were on Twisted Fate. He felt the gambling hall's many patrons regarding him with a mixture of envy, vicarious excitement, and spiteful longing for him to lose everything on the turn of the last card. Beyond the avarice common to dens of chance, Twisted Fate felt a singular purpose at work here, a noose being slowly drawn around his neck. The cards were twitching in agitation, warning him of danger. He knew he should fold and get out before whoever was hunting him sprang their trap, but the opportunity to make a pauper of the man across the table was too enticing to forego.''\n\n''He grinned at his opponent, a greedy merchant whose fortune was built on the whipped backs of enslaved miners. The man's robes were expensive: Freljord furs, hand-tooled leather, and Bilgewater sea charms. Every finger boasted a ring of blood gold worth more than most men would see in a lifetime. Aromatic smoke drifted from clay pipes to hang over the fortune in coin, jewelry, and deeds lying between them like a pirate's treasure horde.''\n\n''Twisted Fate nodded toward the merchant.''\n\n''&quot;I do believe it's your call, Master Henmar.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I am aware of the rules, river rat,&quot; said Henmar, as Twisted Fate ran his tattooed fingers in a repeating spiral pattern on the backs of his cards. &quot;And do not think any of your fancy sleight of hand is going to distract me into making an error of judgment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Distract you?&quot; said Twisted Fate, exuding laconic confidence in every gesture. &quot;I declare, I would never stoop to such a low and dishonorable ruse.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No? Then why is it your eyes keep darting from the table?&quot; said Henmar. &quot;Listen closely, I have negotiated with the best of them, and I know the tell of a desperate man when I see it.&quot;''\n\n''Twisted Fate gave a sly grin, swapping the cards between his hands and theatrically doffing his wide-brimmed hat.''\n\n''&quot;You're sharp, sir. I can see that,&quot; he said, sweeping his gaze across the gathered crowd. The usual collection of hangers-on; men and women hoping that whoever won might be generous to those nearby. The cards trembled as Twisted Fate's eyes fell upon certain individuals and he felt his mouth fill with the rancid flavor of sour milk. He'd long learned to trust that reaction as a sign of imminent bedlam.''\n\n''There. A man with an eye patch and a flame-haired woman. They were almost certainly armed and well aware of his slippery nature. Did he know them? Probably not. Were they working for Henmar, protecting his assets? Unlikely. A man like Henmar would make it obvious who he'd brought. Bounty hunters then. The cards were growing ever more alarmed in Twisted Fate's hands. He slipped them together and placed them flat on the table.''\n\n''&quot;You have a look that tells me you know you have already lost,&quot; said Henmar with the tone of a man who believes everyone to be his inferior.''\n\n''&quot;Then what say we make this a little more interesting, sir?&quot; replied Twisted Fate, spreading the cards in a fan and watching as the hunters eased closer. &quot;Care to double down?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Are you able to cover that much?&quot; asked Henmar suspiciously.''\n\n''&quot;Easily,&quot; said Twisted Fate, locking his gaze with the merchant and lifting a heavy pouch of coins from the voluminous pockets of his long coat. &quot;Can you?&quot;''\n\n''Henmar licked his lips and snapped his fingers. A flunky behind the merchant handed him a matching bag of coins. The patrons of Fortune's Glory gave a collective moan as it was added to the gold heaped in the middle of the table. Wars had been waged for less coin than was at stake here.''\n\n''&quot;You first,&quot; said Henmar.''\n\n''&quot;Always,&quot; agreed Twisted Fate, flipping over his cards as the bounty hunters made their move.''\n\n''The man with the eye patch lunged at him with a capture collar. The woman shouted his name and drew a matching pair of pistols.''\n\n''Twisted Fate kicked the underside of the table, spinning it into the air in a shower of coins, cards, and parchment. The pistols fired with deafening roars, blasting fist-sized holes in the table. The capture collar snapped closed, but when the smoke cleared and the screams stopped, Twisted Fate was nowhere to be found.''\n\n''Henmar rose to his feet, his face twisted in outrage as he searched in vain for his opponent. He looked down at the broken pieces of the table and the color drained from his face.''\n\n''&quot;Where is the money?&quot; he yelled. &quot;Where is my money?&quot;''\n\n''Five cards fluttered face-up to the floor of Fortune's Glory.''\n\n''A winning hand.''\n{{clr}}\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n", "id": 4}, "Chogath": {"key": "Chogath", "name": "Cho'Gath", "title": "the Terror of the Void", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Cho'Gath\n|alias = The Terror of the Void\n|render = Cho'Gath Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = *[[Void]]born &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;([[Cyborg]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution|Battlecast]] Member {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]] \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Malzahar \n|friends = Kog'Maw, Kha'Zix, Vel'Koz\n|rivals = \n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast Army]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Woe betides the day when {{ci|Cho'Gath}} grows weary of the League.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere is a place between dimensions, between worlds. To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown. To those that truly know, however, it is called [[the Void]]. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things - horrors not meant for minds of men. Cho'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name. Its fellows have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into [[Runeterra]], where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world. They are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have been removed from history altogether. It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity.\n\nIf such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will return. Even now, something dark stirs in [[Icathia]], perverting the summoning rituals of [[the League]] to allow the presence of Cho'Gath. It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear. Cho'Gath even appears to {{ai|Feast|Cho'Gath|feed}} on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself. Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a monster could be contained. Fortunately, the power of the League's summoning has confined Cho'Gath's presence exclusively to the League of Legends. It is here that summoners use Cho'Gath's Voidborn abilities to help decide the fate of Runeterra.

Her skin shimmers with starfire while her eyes burn with the power of the celestial Aspect within her. Armored in gold and bearing a terrible burden of ancient knowledge, Leona brings enlightenment to some, death to others.\n\n==Lore==\nTo live in the lands surrounding the towering peak of Mount Targon is to embrace a life of hardship. That many willingly do so is testament to the power of the human spirit to endure anything in search of meaning and higher purpose. As harsh as the rugged foothills of the mountain's base are, it is nothing compared to the hardships borne by those who dwell on the mountain itself.\n\nLiving high on Targon is fraught with danger. When the glittering mist wreathing the summit descends, it does not come alone. All manner of otherworldly things are left behind when it withdraws; radiant creatures that kill at random and muttering voices that whisper unspeakable secrets to drive mortals mad.\n\nEking a living from mountain plants and their precious herds, the Rakkor tribe dwells at the very limits of human endurance; honing their warrior skills to fight the war at the end of the world. Rakkor means Tribe of the Last Sun, and its people believe that many worlds have existed before this one, each of which has been destroyed by a great catastrophe. Its seers teach that when this sun is destroyed there will be no more, so its warriors must be ready to fight those who seek to extinguish its light.\n \nTo the Rakkor, battle is an act of devotion, an offering to keep the sun's light shining. All members of the tribe are expected to fight and kill without mercy or hesitation, and Leona was no exception. She learned to fight as soon as she could walk, mastering sword and shield with ease. She was fascinated by the mists wreathing the summit and often wondered what might lie beyond them. That fascination did not stop her from fighting the ferocious beasts, inhuman entities and pallid, eyeless strangers that came down the mountain.\n\nShe fought and killed them as she had been taught until one day when young Leona encountered a golden-skinned boy with horns and bat-like wings wandering on the mountainside. He did not speak her language, but it was clear he was lost and frightened. His skin shimmered with soft light, and though everything she had been taught since birth told her to attack, Leona could not bring herself to murder someone so obviously helpless. Instead, she led the boy to a pathway leading to the summit, watching as he walked into a ray of sunlight and vanished.\n\nWhen she returned to the Rakkor, she found herself accused of failing in her duty to the sun. A boy named {{ci|Pantheon|Atreus}} had seen her leading a creature of the mountain to safety instead of killing it. Atreus had told his father what Leona had done and he in turn denounced her as a heretic for going against the beliefs of her people. Leona did not dispute this, and the laws of the Rakkor allowed only one sentence for such a transgression - trial by combat. Leona would face Atreus in the fighting pits beneath the noonday sun, and by its light would judgment be rendered. Leona and Atreus were evenly matched; her warrior skills were formidable, but Atreus had ever been single-minded in his pursuit of martial excellence. Leona took up her sword and shield, Atreus his long spear, and none who gathered around the pit could predict the battle's outcome.\n\nLeona and Atreus fought beneath the blazing sun, and though both bled freely from dozens of wounds, neither could land a deathblow. As the sun dipped toward the horizon, an elder of the Solari marched into the Rakkor camp with three gold-armored warriors and called a halt to the duel. The Solari were adherents of a martial faith built around sun worship, whose unforgiving tenets dictated life around and upon Mount Targon. The elder had been led to the Rakkor by dreams and an ancient Solari prophecy that spoke of a warrior whose fire burned brighter than the sun, a daughter of Targon who would bring unity to the celestial realm. The elder believed Leona was that daughter and upon learning the nature of her transgression, his belief was only strengthened.\n\nThe tribal seers warned against interfering in the duel, but the elder was adamant; Leona must come with him and become one of the Solari, to be fully instructed in their beliefs. The Rakkor were fiercely independent, but even they paid heed to the holy decrees of the Solari. The warriors lifted Leona from the pit and bore her wounded body from the Rakkor toward her new life.\n \nThe Solari temple was a towering citadel on the eastern slopes of Mount Targon, a glittering spire of gold-veined marble and polished granite. Here, Leona learned the ways of the sacred order \u2013 how they worshipped the sun as the source of all life and rejected all other forms of light as false. Its strictures were absolute and unyielding, but fueled by her belief in the elder's prophecy, Leona excelled in this disciplined environment, devouring her new faith's teachings as a parched man in a desert seizes upon fresh water. Leona trained every day with the warrior order of the Solari, the Ra-Horak - a Rakkor title which means Followers of the Horizon - honing her already fearsome skills with a blade into something sublime. In time, Leona rose to command the Ra-Horak, becoming known around Mount Targon as a just, devoted and, some might say, zealous servant of the Sun.\n \nHer path changed forever when she was called to escort a young member of the Solari to the heart of the temple. The girl's hair was purest white and a shimmering rune glowed upon her forehead. Her name was {{ci|Diana}}, a troublemaker well known to Leona from the exasperated woes of the temple elders. Diana had gone missing months before, but now returned, clad in a suit of pale armor that glinted with strange silver light. Diana claimed to bring great news, revelations that would shake the Solari to its foundations, but which she would only reveal to the temple elders.\n \nLeona brought Diana in under armed guard, for her warrior instinct sensed something awry in the girl's demeanor. Presented to the elders, Diana spoke of the {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|Lunari}}, an ancient and proscribed faith that venerated the moon, and how all the truths the Solari clung to were incomplete. She described a realm beyond the mountaintop, a place where the sun and moon were not enemies, where new truths could show them fresh ways to look at the world. Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke, and when the elders rejected her words and named her a blasphemer, Leona knew it would be her blade that ended the heretic's life.\n\nLeona saw Diana's incredulous fury at the elders' denial, but before she could react, the white-haired girl {{ai|Lunar Rush|Diana|hurled herself forward}}. {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|Blinding light}} exploded from Diana's outstretched hands, and {{ai|Pale Cascade|Diana|orbs of silver fire}} burned the elders to dust in the blink of an eye. White flames surged in a hurricane of cold lightning and blasted Leona from the chamber. When she regained consciousness, she found Diana gone and the Solari leaderless. As its remaining members struggled to come to terms with this attack on their most sacred space, Leona knew there was only one path open to her. She would hunt down and destroy the heretic Diana for the murder of the Solari elders.\n\nDiana's trail was easy to find. The heretic's footsteps were like shimmering mercury to Leona's eyes, leading ever higher up the slopes of Mount Targon. Leona did not falter, climbing through a landscape that seemed strange and unfamiliar, as though she followed paths that had never existed until this moment. The sun and moon passed overhead in a blur, as if many days and nights passed with her every breath. She neither stopped to eat nor drink, letting fury sustain her beyond what should have been humanly possible.\n\nEventually Leona reached the top of the mountain, breathless, exhausted, starved and stripped of all thought save punishing Diana. There, sitting on a rock at the top of the mountain was the same golden-skinned boy whose life she had spared as a child. Behind him, the sky burned with blazing light, a borealis of impossible colors and the suggestion of a majestic city of gold and silver. In its fluted towers and glittering minarets, Leona saw how the Solari temple echoed its magnificence and fell to her knees in rapture.\n\nThe golden-skinned boy spoke to her in the old Rakkor tongue, telling her he had been waiting for her to follow him since that day, and that he hoped she wasn't too late. He held out his hand and offered to show her miracles and to know the minds of gods.\n\nLeona had never turned from anything in her life. She took the boy's hand as he smiled and led her into the light. A column of searing illumination stabbed down from the heavens and engulfed Leona. She felt an awesome presence filling her limbs with terrifying power and forgotten knowledge from the earliest epochs of the world. Her armor and weapons burned to ash in the cosmic fire and were in turn reborn as ornate warplate, {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona|a shield of sunlight}} wrought in gold and {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona|a sword of chained dawnlight}}.\n\nThe warrior who came down the mountain looked the same as the one who had climbed it, but inside Leona was much changed. She still had her memories and thoughts, was still master of her own flesh, but a sliver of something vast and inhuman had chosen her to be its mortal vessel. It gifted her with incredible powers and awful knowledge that haunted her eyes and weighed heavily upon her soul; knowledge she could only ever share with one person.\n\nNow, more than ever, Leona knew she had to find Diana.\n\n;The Light Bringer\nThe raiders attacked before dawn; fifty wolf-lean men in iron hauberks mantled with strange furs and bearing ash-dulled axes. Their steps were swift as they entered the settlement at the foot of the mountain. These were men who had fought as brothers for years, who lived in the heartbeat between life and death. A warrior in battered scale armor and bearing a heavy-bladed greatsword over his shoulder led them. Beneath his dragon-helm, his face was bearded and raw, burned by a lifetime of war-making under a harsher sun than this.\n\nThe previous settlements had been easily overcome; little challenge for men weaned on battle. The spoils were few and far between, but in this strange land, a man took what he could get. \n\n''This one would be no different.''\n\nSudden light flared ahead, sunlight gleaming brightly. \n\n''Impossible. Dawn was an hour or more away.''\n\nThe leader raised a callused hand as he saw a lone figure standing athwart the settlement's street. He grinned as he saw it was a woman. ''Finally, something worth plundering.'' Light inflamed her, and the grin fell from his face as he stepped closer and saw she was clad in ornate warplate. Auburn hair spilled from a golden circlet and sunlight glinted from {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona|her heavy shield}} and {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona|long-bladed sword.}}\n\nMore warriors emerged from the street, taking their place to either side of the woman, each gold-armored and bearing a long spear.\n\n''&quot;These lands are under my protection&quot;'', she said.\n\n{{ci|Leona}} lifted her sword as the twelve warriors of the Ra-Horak formed a wedge with her at their center. Six to either side, they swung their shields and hammered them down as one. Leona made a quarter turn and locked her own shield into place at the apex. Her sword slid into the thrust groove beneath the shield's bladed halo.\n\nShe flexed her fingers on the leather-wound grip of her sword, feeling the surge-tide of power within her. A coiled fire that ached to be released. Leona held it within her, letting it ease into her flesh. Embers flecked her eyes and her heart pounded in her chest. The being she had joined with atop the mountain longed to burn these men with its cleansing fire.\n\n''Dragon-helm is the key. Kill him and the rest will falter.''\n\nPart of Leona wanted to give the power in her free reign; wanted to scorch these men to smoldering bone and ash. Their attacks had killed scores of people who called the lands around [[Mount Targon]] home. They had defiled the sacred places of the {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|Solari}}, toppling sacred sun stones and polluting the mountain springs with their excretions.\n\nDragon-helm laughed and swung his greatsword from his shoulders as his men moved away from him. To fight with such a huge weapon and keep it in constant motion needed space. He yelled something in a guttural tongue that sounded more like animal barks than anything human, and his warriors gave an answering roar.\n\nLeona let out a hot breath as the raiders charged, their braided beards flecked with frothed spittle as they pounded toward the Ra-Horak. Leona let the fire into her blood, feeling the ancient creature merge its essence with hers more completely, becoming one with her senses and gifting her with perceptions not of this world.\n\nTime slowed for Leona. She saw the pulsing glow of each enemy's heart and heard the thunderous drum-beat of their blood. To her, their bodies were hazed with the red fires of battle-lust. Dragon-helm leapt forward, his sword hammering Leona's shield like a stone titan's fist. The impact was ferocious, buckling the metal and driving her back a full yard. The Ra-Horak stepped back with her, keeping the shieldwall unbroken. Leona's shield blazed with light and Dragon-helm's mantle of fur smoldered in its furnace heat. His eyes widened in surprise as he hauled his enormous sword back for another strike.\n\n''&quot;Brace and thrust!&quot;'' she yelled as the rest of the raiders hit their line. Golden spears thrust at the instant of impact and the first rank of attackers fell with their bellies pierced by mountain-forged steel. They were trampled underfoot as the warriors behind them pressed the attack.\n\nThe shieldwall buckled, but held. Axes smashed down, sinews swelled and throats grunted with the effort of attack. Leona thrust her sword through the neck of a raider with a scar bisecting his face from crown to jaw. He screamed and fell back, his throat filling with blood. Her shield slammed into the face of the man next to him, caving in his skull.\n\nThe Ra-Horak's line bent back as Dragon-helm's sword slammed down again, this time splintering the shield of the warrior next to her. The man dropped, cloven from neck to pelvis.\n\nLeona didn't give Dragon-helm the chance for a third strike.\n\nShe thrust her golden sword toward him and a searing echo of its image blazed from the rune-cut blade. White-hot fire engulfed Dragon-helm, his furs and hair instantly igniting and his armor fusing to his flesh like a brand. He shrieked in hideous pain, and Leona felt the cosmic power inside her revel in the man's agony. He staggered backward, somehow still alive and screaming as her fire melted the flesh from his bones. His men faltered in their assault as he fell to his knees as a blazing pyre.\n\n''&quot;Into them!&quot;'' shouted Leona, and the Ra-Horak surged forward. Powerful arms stabbed spear blades with brutal efficiency. Thrust, twist, withdraw. Over and over again like the relentless arms of a threshing machine. The raiders turned and fled from the Ra-Horak's blood-wetted blades, horrified at their war-leader's doom. Now they sought only to escape.\n\nHow and why these raiders had come to Targon was a mystery, for they had clearly not come to bear witness on the mountain nor make an ascent. They were warriors, not pilgrims, and left alive they would only regroup to kill again.\n\nLeona could not allow that and thrust her sword into the earth. She reached deep inside herself, drawing on the awesome power from beyond the mountain. The sun emerged from behind its highest peaks as Leona thrust her hand to the light.\n \nShe dropped to one knee and slammed her fist on the ground. \n\nAnd {{ai|Solar Flare|Leona|sunfire}} rained from the sky.\n\n", "id": 89}, "Caitlyn": {"key": "Caitlyn", "name": "Caitlyn", "title": "the Sheriff of Piltover", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Caitlyn\n|alias =\n* The Sheriff of Piltover\n* Cupcake\n* Hat Lady\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Piltover Peacemaker|Caitlyn|Peacemaker}}\n* {{ai|Yordle Snap Trap|Caitlyn}}\n* {{ai|90 Caliber Net|Caitlyn}}\n|render = Caitlyn Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = [[Piltover]] Police Force Sheriff\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Jayce, Ezreal, Vi\n|rivals = Jinx, Ekko\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Go ahead, run.

This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover.\n\nBorn the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, as she was single-handedly defeating crime in Piltover and had developed into a ravishing beauty as well. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by [[Demacia]] to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.\n\nThe bandit, who always left a card with an ornate {{sbc|'C'}} at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across [[Valoran]].

Darius' captain called for his troops to retreat, but Darius refused to accept such an act of cowardice. Breaking formation, Darius strode towards the captain and {{ai|Noxian Guillotine|Darius|decapitated him}} with one sweep of his gigantic axe. Both terrified and inspired, the soldiers followed Darius into battle and fought with incredible strength and fervor. After a long and grueling battle, they ultimately emerged victorious. Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops in a devastating campaign against Demacia.\n\nAfter proving his power on the battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation's strength. Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to reshape the Noxian leadership.

I will make it so again.&quot;'' - {{ci|Azir}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAzir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an [[Ascended]] being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.\n\n==Lore==\nThousands of years ago, the Shuriman empire was a sprawling realm of vassal states conquered by powerful armies led by all but invincible warriors known as the Ascended. Ruled by an ambitious and power hungry emperor, Shurima was the greatest realm of its day; a fertile land blessed by the power of the sun that shone from a great golden disc floating atop the temple at the heart of its capital.\n\nThe youngest and least-favored son of the emperor, Azir was never destined for greatness. With so many siblings ahead of him, he would never be emperor. Most likely he would take up a position in the priesthood or as governor of some backwater province. He was a slender, studious boy who spent more time perusing the texts collected in the Great Library of {{ci|Nasus}} than training to fight under the stern tutelage of the Ascended hero, {{ci|Renekton}}.\n\nAmid the twisting shelves of scrolls, books and tablets, Azir met a young slave boy who visited the library almost every day in search of texts desired by his master. Slaves in Shurima were forbidden to take names, but as the two boys became friends, Azir broke that law and called his new friend {{ci|Xerath}}, which means 'one who shares'. He appointed Xerath - though he was careful never to endanger him by naming him publicly - as his personal slave and the two boys shared their love of history by learning all they could of Shurima's past and its long legacy of Ascended heroes.\n\nWhile traveling with his father, brothers and Renekton on the yearly tour of the empire, the royal caravan stopped at a well-known oasis for the night. Azir and Xerath stole away in the middle of the night to draw the stars and add their own celestial maps to those they had studied in the Great Library. While they drew the patterns of constellations, the royal caravan was attacked by a cabal of assassins sent by the emperor's enemies. One of the assassins found the two boys out in the desert and was poised to cut Azir's throat when Xerath intervened, throwing himself upon the assassin's back. In the ensuing melee, Azir freed his dagger and plunged it into his attacker\u2019s throat.\n\nAzir took up the dead man's sword and rushed back to the oasis, but by the time he returned, the assassins were already defeated. Renekton had protected the emperor and slain the attackers, but Azir's brothers were all dead. Azir told his father of Xerath's courage and asked him to reward the slave boy, but his words fell on deaf ears. In the emperor's eyes, the boy was a slave and beneath his notice, but Azir swore that one day he and Xerath would be brothers.\n\nThe emperor returned to his capital, with the fifteen year old Azir now his heir, and unleashed a merciless campaign of bloodshed against those he believed had sent the assassins. Shurima descended into years of paranoia and murder as the emperor took revenge on any he suspected of treason. Though he was now heir to the throne, Azir's life yet hung by a thread. His father hated him - wishing he had died instead of his brothers - and the queen was still young enough to bear sons.\n\nAzir trained in combat, for the attack at the oasis had revealed how little he knew of the deadly arts. Renekton took up the task of teaching the growing prince, and under his aegis, Azir learned to wield sword and spear, {{ai|Arise!|Azir|to command warriors}}, and to read the ebb and flow of battle. The young heir elevated Xerath, his only trusted confidant, and made him his right-hand man. To better counsel him, Azir tasked Xerath with seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it.\n\nYears passed, but the queen was never able to carry a child to term, every conceived infant perishing before it could be born. So long as the queen remained barren, Azir's life was relatively safe. Some around the court believed a curse was at work and a few even whispered the young heir's name in connection with this \u2013 though Azir claimed innocence and even executed some who dared voice such accusations openly.\n\nEventually, the queen bore a healthy son, but on the night of his birth a terrible storm engulfed Shurima. The queen's chambers were struck again and again by powerful bolts of lightning, and in the subsequent blaze, both the queen and her newborn son were killed. It was said the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life upon hearing the news, but tales soon spread of how he and his guards had been found lying in pieces on the palace floor, their bodies little more than charred skeletons.\n\nAzir was shocked by their deaths, but the empire needed a leader, and with Xerath at his side he took control of Shurima as its emperor. Over the next decade, he expanded Shurima's borders and ruled with a harsh, but just hand. He instituted reforms to better the lives of slaves and privately developed a plan to overturn millennia of tradition and eventually free them all. He kept his plans secret, even from Xerath, and the issue of slavery would prove to be a continual bone of contention between them. The empire had been built on the back of slavery, and many of the great noble houses depended on enforced labor for their vast wealth and power. Such monolithic institutions could not be overturned overnight, and Azir's plans would be undone were they to become common knowledge. Despite Azir's desire to name Xerath his brother, he could not do so until all Shurima's slaves were free.\n\nThrough these years, Xerath protected Azir from his political rivals and guided the expansion of the empire. Azir married and fathered numerous children, some by wedlock, others by ill-advised liaisons with slaves and harem girls. Xerath stoked the emperor's grand vision of an empire greater than any the world had ever known. But to stand as ruler over the entire world, Xerath convinced Azir that he would need to be all but invincible, a god amongst men \u2013 an Ascended being.\n\nAs the kingdom reached the zenith of its power, Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that the time was right for him to take his place alongside Nasus and Renekton and their glorious forebears. Many questioned this decision; the Ascension ritual was highly dangerous and intended only for those near the end of their lives, those who had devoted their lives to Shurima and whose service was to be honored with Ascension. It was for the Sun Priests to decree who would be blessed with Ascension, not the hubris of an emperor to bestow it upon himself. Azir would not be dissuaded from his rash course of action, for his arrogance had grown along with his empire, and he ordered them to comply on pain of death.\n\nThe day of the ritual finally came and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension, flanked by thousands of his warriors and tens of thousands of his subjects. The brothers Renekton and Nasus were absent, having been dispatched by Xerath to deal with an emergent threat, but still Azir would not turn from what he saw as his great destiny. He climbed to {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|the great golden disc}} atop the temple at the heart of the city and in the moments before the sun priests began the ritual, he turned to Xerath and finally freed him. And not just him, but all slaves...\n\nXerath was stunned into speechlessness, but Azir was not yet done. He embraced Xerath and named him his eternal brother, as he had promised he would all those years ago. Azir turned as the priests began the ritual to bring down the awesome power of the sun. Azir was unaware that Xerath had studied more than just history and philosophy in his quest for knowledge. He had learned the dark arts of sorcery, all the while nursing a desire for freedom that had grown like a cancer into a burning hatred.\n\nAt the height of the ritual, the former slave unleashed his powers and Azir was blasted from his place on the dais. Without the protection of the runic circle, Azir was consumed by the sun's fire as Xerath took his place. The light filled Xerath with power, and he roared as his mortal body began to transform.\n\nBut the magic of the ritual was not intended for Xerath, and such awesomely powerful celestial energies could not be diverted without dire consequence. The power of the Ascension ritual exploded outward, devastating Shurima and laying waste to the city. Its people burned to ash and its towering palaces fell to ruin as the desert sands rose up to swallow the city. The sun disc sank from the sky and what had taken centuries to build was brought to ruin in an instant by one man's ambition and another's misplaced hate. All that remained of Azir's city were sunken ruins and echoes of its people's screams on the night winds.\n\nAzir saw none of this. For him, all was nothingness. His last memories were of pain and fire; he knew nothing of what befell him atop the temple, nor what became of his empire. He remained lost in timeless oblivion until, thousands of years after Shurima's doom, the blood of {{ci|Sivir|his last descendant}} spilled onto the temple ruins and resurrected him. Azir was reborn, but was yet incomplete; his body little more than animate dust given form, held together by the last vestiges of his indomitable will.\n\nGradually resuming his corporeal form, Azir stumbled through the ruins and came across the corpse of a woman with a treacherous knife wound in her back. He did not know her, but saw in her features the distant echo of his bloodline. All thoughts of empires and power were forgotten as he lifted this daughter of Shurima and bore her to what had once been the Oasis of the Dawn. The oasis was empty and dry, but with every step Azir took, clear water began filling the rocky basin. Azir immersed the woman's body in the restorative waters of the oasis and as the blood washed away, only a faint scar remained where the blade had pierced her.\n\nAnd with that act of selflessness, Azir was lifted up in a column of fire as the magic of Shurima renewed him, remaking him as the Ascended being he was meant to become. The sun's immortal radiance poured into him, crafting his magnificent, hawk-armored form and granting him the power to command the very sand itself. Azir lifted his arms and his ruined city shrugged off the dust of centuries spent beneath the desert to rise anew. The {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} lifted into the sky once more, and healing waters flowed between temples heaving themselves back into the light at the emperor's command.\n\nAzir climbed the steps of the newly-risen sun temple, weaving the desert winds to recreate the city's last moments. Ghosts formed of sand relived his city's last moments from long ago, and Azir watched in horror as Xerath's treachery unfolded. He wept as he saw his family murdered, his empire fall and his power stolen. Only now, millennia too late, did he finally understand the depths of hatred harbored by his former friend and ally. With the power and prescience of an Ascended being, Azir sensed Xerath somewhere abroad in the world and summoned {{ai|Arise!|Azir|an army of sand warriors}} to march alongside their reborn emperor. As the sun blazed from {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|the golden disc}} above him, Azir swore a mighty oath.\n\n''I will reclaim my lands and take back what was mine!''\n\n;Arisen\n{{ci|Azir}} walked the gold-paved Emperor's Way. The immense statues of [[Shurima]]'s earliest rulers \u2013 his ancestors \u2013 watched his progress.\n\nThe soft, shadowy light of predawn seeped through his city. The brightest stars still shone overhead, though they would soon be snuffed out by the rising sun. The night sky was not as Azir remembered it; the stars and the constellations were misaligned. Millennia had passed.\n\nWith every step, Azir's heavy staff of office struck a lonely note, echoing through the capital's empty streets.\n\nWhen last he had walked this path, an honor guard of 10,000 elite warriors had marched in his wake, and the cheers of the crowd had shaken the city. It was to have been his moment of glory \u2013 yet it had been stolen from him.\n\nNow, it was a city of ghosts. What had become of his people?\n\nWith an imperious gesture, Azir commanded the sands beside the roadway to rise, creating living statues. This was a vision of the past, the echoes of Shurima given form.\n\nThe sand figures looked forward, heads tilted toward the immense {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} hanging above the Dais of Ascension half a league ahead. It hung there still, declaring the glory and power of Azir's empire, though no one remained to see it. {{ci|Sivir|The daughter of Shurima}} who awakened him, she who bore his lineage, was gone. He sensed her out in the desert. Blood bound them together. \n\nAs Azir walked the Emperor's Way, the sand-echoes of his people pointed up at the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}, their joyful expressions turning to horror. Mouths opened wide in silent screams. They turned to run, stumbling and falling. Azir watched this all in despairing silence, bearing witness to the last moments of his people.\n\nThey were obliterated by a wave of unseen energy, reduced to dust and cast to the winds. What had gone wrong with his Ascension to unleash this catastrophe?\n\nAzir's focus narrowed. His march became more resolute. He reached the base of the Stairs of Ascension and began to climb, taking them five at a time.\n\nOnly his most trusted soldiers, the priesthood, and those of the royal bloodline were allowed to step foot upon the Stairs. Sand versions of these most favored subjects lined his path, faces upturned, grimacing and wailing in silence before they too were swept away by the winds.\n\nHe ran, taking the steps faster than any man could, talons digging into the stonework, carving furrows where they caught. Sand figures rose, and were then destroyed, to either side of him as he climbed.\n\nHe reached the top. Here, he saw the final circle of onlookers: his closest aides, his advisers, the high priests. His family.\n\nAzir dropped to his knees. His family was before him, rendered in perfect, heartbreaking detail. His wife, heavy with child. His shy daughter, clutching his wife's hand. His son, standing tall, on the brink of becoming a man.\n\nIn horror, Azir saw their expressions change. Though he knew what was to come, he could not look away. His daughter hid her face in the folds of his wife's dress; his son reached for his sword, shouting in defiance. His wife... her eyes widened, sorrow and despair writ within.\n\nThe unseen event blasted them to nothingness.\n\nIt was too much, but no tears welled in Azir's eyes. His [[Ascended]] form rendered that simple act of grief forever lost to him. With a heavy heart, he pushed himself to his feet. The question remained as to how {{ci|Sivir|his bloodline}} survived, for it most assuredly had.\n\nThe final echo awaited.\n\nHe advanced, halting one step below the Dais, and watched as it all played out before him, re-enacted in the sand.\n\nHe saw himself, in his mortal form, rise up into the air beneath the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}, arms wide and back arched. He remembered this moment. The power coursed through him, infusing his being, filling him with its divine strength.\n\nA newcomer formed in the sand. His trusted bondsman, his magus, {{ci|Xerath}}.\n\nHis friend uttered a silent word. Azir watched himself shatter like glass, exploding into motes of sand.\n\n''&quot;Xerath&quot;'', breathed Azir.\n\nThe traitor\u2019s expression was unknowable, but Azir could see nothing but the face of a murderer.\n\nWhere did such hate come from? Azir had never been aware of it.\n\nThe sand image of Xerath rose higher into the air as the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}'s energies focused into his being. A cadre of elite guards rushed toward him, but they were all far too late.\n\nA brutal shockwave of sand flared out, disintegrating the final moment of Shurima. Azir stood alone among the dying echoes of his past.\n\nThis is what killed his people.\n\nAzir turned away, just as the first rays of the new dawn struck the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} overhead. He'd seen enough. The sand image of the transformed Xerath collapsed behind him.\n\nThe dawn sun reflected blindingly off Azir's flawless golden armor. In that instant, he knew that the traitor still lived. He sensed the magus's essence in the air that he breathed.\n\nAzir lifted a hand, and {{ai|Arise!|Azir|an army of his elite warriors}} rose from the sands at the base of the Stairs of Ascension.\n\n''&quot;Xerath&quot;'', he said, his voice tinged with rage.

Torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility, she has crossed nearly all of [[Valoran]] on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers. Compelled by rumors of the rise of {{ci|Azir|a long-dead emperor}}, she returns to protect her tribe from dangers uncovered by Shurima's shifting sands. Some have mistaken her tender heart for weakness and paid the price for their error, for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth tremble.\n\n==Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\nMain=\nBorn in the rocky foothills bordering [[Icathia]]'s corrupted shadow, Taliyah spent her childhood herding goats with her tribe of nomadic weavers. Where most outsiders see Shurima as a beige and barren waste, her family raised her to be a true daughter of the desert and to see beauty in the rich hues of the land. Taliyah was always fascinated by the stone beneath the dunes. When she was a toddler, she collected colorful rocks as her people followed the seasonal waters. As she grew older, the earth itself seemed drawn to her, arcing and twisting to follow her tracks through the sand.\n\nAfter her sixth high summer, Taliyah wandered from the caravan in search of a lost goatling that had been placed in her charge. Determined not to disappoint her father - the master shepherd and headman of the tribe - she tracked the young animal into the night. She followed the hoofprints through a dry wash to a box canyon. The little beast had managed to get high up the rock wall, but could not get down.\n\nThe sandstone called to her, urging her to pull handholds from the sheer wall. Taliyah laid a tentative palm against the rock, determined to rescue the scared animal. The elemental power she felt was as urgent and overwhelming as a monsoon rain. As soon as she opened herself to the magic, it poured over her, the stone leaping to her fingertips, bringing both the canyon wall and the beast down on top of her.\n\nThe next morning, Taliyah's panicked father tracked the skittish bleats of the goatling. He fell to his knees when he found his daughter unconscious, covered loosely in a blanket of woven stone. Grief-stricken, he returned to the tribe with Taliyah.\n\nTwo days later, the girl awoke from fevered dreams in the tent of Babajan, the tribe's grandmother. Taliyah began to tell the wise woman and her concerned parents of her night in the canyon, of the rock that called to her. Babajan consoled the family, telling them that the patterns of rock were evidence the Great Weaver, the desert tribe's mythical protector, watched over the girl. In that moment, Taliyah saw her parents' deep worry and decided to conceal what really happened that night: that she - not the Great Weaver - had pulled at the desert stone.\n\nWhen children in Taliyah's tribe were old enough, they performed a dance under the face of the full moon, the manifestation of the Great Weaver herself. The dance celebrated the children's innate talents and demonstrated the gifts they would bring to the tribe as adults. This was the start of their path to true learning, as those children then became apprenticed to their teachers.\n\nTaliyah continued to hide her growing power, believing the secret she carried was a danger, not a blessing. She watched as her childhood playmates spun wool to keep the tribe warm on cold desert nights, demonstrated their skill with shears and dye, or wove patterns that told the stories of her people. On those nights, she would lie awake long after the coals had burned to ash, tormented by the power she felt stirring within.\n\nThe time finally came for Taliyah's dance beneath the full moon. While she had talent enough to be a capable shepherd like her father, or a pattern mistress like her mother, the young girl dreaded what her dance would truly reveal. As Taliyah took her place on the sand, the tools of her people - the shepherd's crook, the spindle, and the loom - surrounded her. She tried to concentrate on the task at hand, but it was the distant rocks, the layered colors of the land, that called to her. Taliyah closed her eyes and danced. Overwhelmed by the power flowing through her, she began to spin not thread, but the very earth beneath her feet.\n\nStartled cries from Taliyah's tribe broke her out of her spell. An imposing {{ai|Weaver's Wall|Taliyah|braid of sharp rock}} reached up to the light of the moon. Taliyah looked at the shocked faces of the people who surrounded her. Her will over the stone broken, the earthen tapestry crashed down. Taliyah's mother ran to her only daughter, to protect her from the falling rock. When the dust finally settled, Taliyah saw the destruction she had woven, the alarm on the faces of her tribe. But it was the small cut across her mother's face that justified Taliyah's fear. Though the cut was minor, Taliyah knew in that moment that she was a threat to the people she loved most in this world. She ran into the night, so weighed down by despair that the ground trembled beneath her feet.\n\nIt was her father who found her again in the desert. As they sat in the light of the rising sun, Taliyah confessed her secret in choked sobs. In turn, he did the only thing a parent could do: He hugged his daughter tightly. He told her that she couldn't run from her power, that she must complete her dance and see where her path would take her. Turning her back on the Great Weaver's gift was the only danger that could truly break his and her mother's heart.\n\nTaliyah returned with her father to the tribe. She entered the dancer's circle with her eyes open. This time, she wove a new {{ai|Weaver's Wall|Taliyah|ribbon of stone}}, each color and texture a memory of the people surrounding her.\n\nWhen it was over, the tribe sat in awe. Taliyah waited nervously. It was time for one of her people to stand as her teacher and claim the student. What felt like eons stretched between Taliyah's hammering heartbeats. She heard gravel shift as her father stood. Next to him, her mother stood. Babajan and the dye mistress and the master spinner stood. In a moment, the whole tribe was on its feet. All of them would stand with the girl who could weave stone.\n\nTaliyah looked at each of them. She knew that a power like hers had not been seen in generations, perhaps longer. They stood with her now, their love and trust surrounding her, but their worry was palpable. None among them heard the earth call as she did. As much as she loved these people, she did not see the one who could show her how to control the elemental magic that coursed within her. She knew that to stay with her tribe was to risk their lives. Though it pained all of them, Taliyah said farewell to her parents and her people, and set off alone into the world.\n\nShe journeyed west toward the distant peak of [[Targon]], her natural connection to rock drawing her toward the mountain that brushed the stars. However, at the northern edge of Shurima, it was those who marched beneath the banner of [[Noxus]] who discovered her power first. In Noxus, magic like hers was celebrated, they told her; revered, even. They promised her a teacher.\n\nThe land had raised Taliyah to be trusting, so she was unprepared for the smooth promises and practiced smiles of Noxian dignitaries. Soon, the desert girl found herself on an unbending path, passing under the many Noxtoraa, the great iron gates that marked the Empire's claim over a conquered land.\n\nThe crush of people and the layers of politics within the capital city were claustrophobic to a girl from the open desert. Taliyah was paraded through the tiers of Noxian magical society. Many took an interest in her power, its potential, but it was a fallen captain who swore to take her to a wild place across the sea, a place where she could hone her abilities without fear, who made the most convincing case. She accepted the young officer's offer and crossed the sea to [[Ionia]]. However, it was made clear as their ship dropped anchor that she was intended as a glorified weapon for a man desperate to regain his place at the highest ranks of the Noxian navy. At dawn, the captain gave her a choice: Bury a sleeping people in their homes, or be discarded in the surf.\n\nTaliyah looked across the bay. The cooking smoke had not yet risen from the village's sleeping hearths. This was not the lesson she had come so far to learn. Taliyah refused, and the captain threw her overboard to drown.\n\nShe escaped the tide and the fighting on the beach and found herself wandering, lost, in the wintry mountains of Ionia. It was there she finally discovered her {{ci|Yasuo|teacher}}, a man whose blade harnessed the wind itself, someone who understood the elements and the need for balance. She trained with him for a time and began to find the control she had long sought.\n\nWhile resting at an isolated inn, Taliyah heard that the [[Ascended]] {{ci|Azir|Emperor of Shurima}} had returned to his desert kingdom. Rumor had it this emperor turned god sought to gather his people, the disparate tribes, back to him as slaves. Even with her training unfinished, there was no other choice; she knew she must return to her family to protect them. Sadly, she and her mentor parted ways.\n\nTaliyah returned home to the sand-swept dunes of Shurima. As the punishing rays of the sun beat down on her, Taliyah pushed farther into the desert, determined to find her people. Hers was a will of stone, and she would do whatever was necessary to protect her family and her tribe from the danger that loomed on the horizon.\n\n", "id": 163}, "Teemo": {"key": "Teemo", "name": "Teemo", "title": "the Swift Scout", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Teemo\n|alias        = * The Swift Scout\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Blinding Dart|Teemo}}\n* {{ai|Toxic Shot|Teemo|Toxic Dart}}\n* {{ai|Noxious Trap|Teemo|Mushroom}}\n|render       = [[File:Teemo Render.png|link=|240px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Bandle City]]\n|occupation   = * Scout\n* &lt;small&gt;(Member of the Omega Squad{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Tristana\n|rivals       = Veigar, Rumble, Tahm Kench\n|related      = * [http://skins.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/omegasquad/ War Changes a Yordle: Omega Squad]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 17}, "Urgot": {"key": "Urgot", "name": "Urgot", "title": "the Headsman's Pride", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Urgot\n|alias        = * The Headsman's Pride\n|render       = [[File:Urgot Render.png|282px|link=]]\n|gender       = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race         = Human &lt;small&gt;(Reanimated)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Noxus]]\n|residence    = [[Noxus]]\n|occupation   = * Unknown \n* &lt;s&gt;Noxian soldier and high executioner&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Member of the [[The Evolution|Battlecast]]{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Noxus_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n* [[Zaun]] \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]]{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Sion, Viktor\n|enemies      = Jarvan IV, Garen\n|related      = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast army]\n}}\n== Lore ==\n\n", "background": "here are warriors who become great for their strength, cunning, or skill with arms.

Those who claim to have seen him describe Amumu as a living cadaver, small in stature and covered in {{ai|Bandage Toss|Amumu|bandages the color of lichen}}. Amumu has inspired myths, folklore, and legends told and retold for generations - such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.\n\n==Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nThe hardy folk of Shurima agree upon certain things: the wind always blows from the west in the morning; a full belly on a new moon is an ill omen; buried treasure hides under the heaviest of rocks. They do not agree, however, about the tale of Amumu.\n\nOne oft-told story links Amumu to the first great ruling family of Shurima who succumbed to a disease that corrupted flesh with hideous speed. The youngest child, Amumu, was quarantined in his chambers and befriended a servant girl who heard his cries through the walls. She regaled the lonely heir with courtly news and stories of her grandmother's mystic powers.\n\nOne morning, the girl brought word that Amumu's last remaining brother had passed away, making him Emperor of Shurima. Saddened that he had to bear this news alone, she unlocked his door and ran inside to comfort him face to face. Amumu threw his arms around her, but as they touched, he fell back, realizing he had condemned}} her to the same terrible fate as his family.\n\nUpon the girl's death, her grandmother placed a twisted blight on the young emperor. In her mind, Amumu had as good as murdered her kin. As the curse took effect, Amumu was trapped in his moment of {{ai|Despair|Amumu|suffering}} like a locust ensnared in honeyed amber.\n\nA second tale whispers of another crown prince, one given to bouts of petulance, cruelty, and murderous vanity. In this telling, Amumu was crowned Emperor of Shurima at a young age, and convinced he was blessed by the sun, he forced his subjects to worship him as a god.\n\nAmumu sought the fabled Eye of Angor, an ancient relic entombed in a gilded crypt, said to grant eternal life to whoever looked upon it with an unflinching heart. He hunted the treasure for years with a host of slaves who carried him through labyrinthine catacombs, sacrificing themselves to traps so the emperor could continue without hindrance. Amumu finally reached the cyclopean golden archway, where upon dozens of his stonemasons labored to breach the sealed door.\n\nAs the young emperor rushed within, determined to look into the Eye of Angor, his slaves seized their chance and sealed the stone doorway behind him. Some say the child emperor endured in the darkness for years, his loneliness driving him to insanity and causing him to claw at his own skin, which he was forced to wrap in bandages. His life was extended by the power of the Eye as he meditated on his past transgressions, but the gift was a double edged sword, for he was cursed to remain forever alone.\n\nWhen a series of devastating earthquakes shattered the foundations of his tomb, the emperor escaped with no knowledge of how much time had passed, seeking to undo the suffering he had caused in life.\n\nYet another story of Amumu tells of the first and last [[Yordle]] ruler of Shurima, who believed in the innate goodness of the human heart. To prove his detractors wrong, he swore an oath to live as a beggar until he made one true friend, convinced his people would rally to help their fellow Shuriman.\n\nThough thousands walked by the disheveled Yordle, not one stopped to offer a helping hand. Amumu's {{ai|Despair|Amumu|sadness}} grew until he eventually died of a broken heart. But his death was not the end, for some swear the Yordle still wanders the desert, forever searching for someone who might restore his faith in humanity.\n\nThese stories, despite their differences, are woven with parallels. Whatever the circumstances, Amumu is doomed to exist in a broken state of emptiness, eternally alone and friendless. Fated to forever search for a companion, his presence is cursed and his touch is death. On long winter nights when the fire is never allowed to burn low, the sad mummy can sometimes be heard weeping in the desert, {{ai|Despair|Amumu|despairing}} that he'll never know the solace of friendship.\n\nWhatever Amumu searches for - atonement, kinship, or a single act of kindness - one thing is as certain as the western wind at dawn: he has yet to find it.\n\n;Greed and Tears\n''&quot;The gods were angry, and shook the land. Cracks rent the earth&quot;'', said old Khaldun, his crag-featured face lit by firelight. ''&quot;It was into one of these fissures that a young man ventured. He found an opening; the entrance to a tomb, hidden for {{ci|Nasus|the Jackal}} knows how long. The man had little ones to feed and a wife to please, and so he ventured in, lured by opportunity.&quot;''\n\nAdults and children alike crowded in close to hear the old storyteller's words. They were all weary - they had traveled far that day, and the [[Shurima]]n sun had been unrelenting - but Khaldun's tales were a rare treat. They drew their cloaks tight around their shoulders against the chill of the night and leaned in.\n\n''&quot;The air was cool in the tomb, a merciful relief from the scorching heat outside. The young man lit a torch. Its light made shadows dance before him. He stepped cautiously, wary of traps. He was poor, but he was no fool.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The walls inside were smooth obsidian and carved with ancient writings and images. He could not read - he was a simple man - but he studied the images.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He saw {{ci|Amumu|a boy prince}}, sitting cross-legged upon a {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} borne by a team of servants, a beaming smile upon his face. Chests of coins and riches were piled before him, the offerings of strangely garbed, bowing emissaries.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He saw other carvings, again showing the smiling prince, this time walking among his people. Their heads were pressed to the ground before him. Stylized rays of sunshine radiated from the boy's crown.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Before one of these images was a small, gold statue. It alone was worth more than he could have hoped to earn in ten lifetimes. The young man took it, slipping it into his satchel.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He did not intend to linger. He knew it would not be long before others came upon this place. When they did, he wanted to be gone. Greed makes fools of even the greatest men, and he knew that others would willingly spill his blood to claim that golden statue - and the other riches that were surely further in. Avarice was not one of the young man's faults, however. He felt no need to delve further. The other treasures hidden here were someone else's to claim.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He looked upon one last image before he left the tomb. It showed the boy prince dead, lying upon a bier. Those closest to him were wailing... but further back, people were celebrating. Had the boy prince been beloved, or had he been a tyrant? There was no way of knowing.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That was when he heard it: a sound in the darkness that made his skin crawl.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He looked around, wide eyed, holding his torch up before him. Nothing.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Who's there?' he said. Silence was his only answer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The young man shook his head. 'It is just the wind, you fool', he thought. 'Nothing but the wind.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then he heard it again, more distinctly this time. A child was crying in the darkness further into the tomb.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Heard anywhere else, his paternal instinct would have been to go to the sound. But here, in the darkness of a funeral tomb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He wanted to run... but he did not. The sobbing touched his heart. It was filled with such misery and grief.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Was it possible there was another entrance to this tomb? Had a young boy found his way down here and become lost?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Torch held high, he crept forward. The weeping continued, echoing faintly through the gloom.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A wide chamber opened before him, its floor black and highly reflective. Golden artifacts and jewel-inlaid walls glinted within. Gingerly, he entered the room.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He stepped back sharply as his heel sent ripples spreading out across the floor. {{ai|Despair|Amumu|Water}}. The floor was not made of reflective obsidian - it was covered in water.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Kneeling, he scooped a handful of it to his lips. He spat it out immediately. It was salt water! Here, in the heart of Shurima, a thousand leagues from the nearest sea!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He heard the sound of the boy weeping once more, closer now.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Holding his torch before him, the young man glimpsed a shape at the edge of its light. It appeared to be the child, sitting with his back to the man.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Carefully, he stepped into the room. The water upon the floor was not deep. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and fear clutched at his chest, yet he did not turn to run.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Are you lost?' he asked, as he stepped closer. 'How did you get here?'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The shadowed figure did not turn... but he did speak.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'I... I don't remember', he said. The sound swam around the young man, echoing off the walls. The boy spoke in an old dialect. His words were strange... but understandable. 'I don't remember who I am.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Be calm, child', said the man. 'All will be well.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He stepped closer, and the figure resolved itself before him. His eyes widened.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The shape before him was a god-statue carved in onyx, nothing more. It was not the source of the crying, nor of the child's voice.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That was when a small, dry hand grabbed him.&quot;''\n\nThe youngest of the listeners gasped, his eyes wide. The other children laughed in false bravado. Old Khaldun smiled, a golden tooth glinting in the firelight. Then, he continued.\n\n''&quot;The young man looked down. The linen-wrapped corpse of the tiny prince stood beside the man. Dull, ghostly light emanated from the deathly boy's eye sockets, though his entire face was bound in burial wrappings. The corpse-child held the man's hand.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Will you be my friend?' the boy asked, his voice muffled by linen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The young man lurched backward, breaking free of the child's grasp. The young man looked down at his arm in horror; his hand was shriveling, turning black and withered. {{ai|Cursed Touch|Amumu|The wasting touch}} then began to climb up his arm.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He turned and ran. In his shock and haste, he dropped his lantern. It hissed as it fell into the lake of tears, and darkness descended. Still, he could just make out the glow of daylight up ahead. He ran toward it, scrambling desperately, even as the wasting death crept up his arm towards his heart.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;At any moment, he expected to feel the deathly boy's grasp upon him... but did not. After what felt like an eternity, but could only have been a matter of heartbeats, he burst from the darkness into the desert heat once more.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'I'm sorry', echoed a mournful voice from the gloom behind him. 'I didn\u2019t mean to.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And thus, the Tomb of Amumu was unearthed&quot;'', said old Khaldun, ''&quot;and the deathly child released into the world.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But everyone knows he isn't real!&quot;'' cried one of the children, the oldest of them, after a moment of silence.\n\n''&quot;Amumu is real!&quot;'' said the youngest. ''&quot;He's wandering the land trying to find a friend!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He's real, but he isn't a boy&quot;'', said another. ''&quot;He's a [[Yordle]]!&quot;''\n\nKhaldun laughed, and pushed himself to his feet with the aid of a gnarled walking stick.\n\n''&quot;I am old, and we have far to travel tomorrow&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;It is past time I was abed.&quot;''\n\nHis audience began to dissipate, smiling and talking in low, familial voices, but one child did not move. She stared at Khaldun, unblinking.\n\n''&quot;Grandfather&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;How did you lose your arm?&quot;''\n\nOld Khaldun looked down at the empty sleeve pinned at his shoulder, then flashed the girl a grin.\n\n''&quot;Goodnight, little one&quot;'', he said with a wink.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 32}, "Galio": {"key": "Galio", "name": "Galio", "title": "the Sentinel's Sorrow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Galio\n|alias = The Sentinel's Sorrow\n|render = Galio Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race =  Magical Construct &lt;small&gt;(Gargoyle)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]]\n|residence = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Poppy, Kayle, Shyvana\n|enemies = Sion\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;There is no such thing as redemption.

One such visionary was the [[Demacia]]n artificer, Durand.\n\nPeerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand's constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their [[Noxus|Noxian]] neighbors.

That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\n\nAs Durand crossed the [[Howling Marsh]] with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in force. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists.\n\nStripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired. For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame.

She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia.\n\nThis encounter lit a spark in Galio's eye.

She chooses each target carefully, waits for the right moment, and then strikes with power and precision. It is with this same vision and focus that she pursues her goal of uniting the tribes of the [[Freljord]] and forging them into a mighty nation.\n\n==Lore==\nAs a child, Ashe was always a dreamer. She marveled at the colossal, abandoned fortresses of her ancestors, and spent hours by the fire listening to tales of the Freljord's fabled champions. Most of all she loved the legend of Avarosa, the renowned Queen of the once magnificent and united Freljord. Though her mother chided her foolishness, Ashe swore one day she would join the scattered and warlike tribes of the tundra. She knew in her heart that if her people would stand together once more, they would reach greatness again.\n\nWhen Ashe was only fifteen, her mother was killed while commanding the tribe on a brash raid. Suddenly thrust into the role of leader, Ashe made the difficult decision to follow her childhood vision instead of seeking the revenge she craved. She spoke passionately against her tribe's demand for retribution, declaring the time had come to put blood feuds aside and broker a lasting peace. Some of her warriors questioned her fitness to rule and soon hatched a treasonous plot to kill the young leader.\n\nThe assassins struck while Ashe was on a routine hunt, but their plan was interrupted by the warning cry of a great hawk. Ashe looked back to see her tribesmen approaching with swords drawn. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Ashe ran for hours. She found herself deep in uncharted territory, her weapon lost in the chase. When she heard another cry from the hawk, Ashe put her faith in the strange creature and followed it to a clearing. There she found the bird perched on a pile of stones - an ancient Freljord burial cairn. With a last glance at her, the hawk screeched and flew away. Approaching the mound, Ashe felt her breath turn to frost and an unnatural cold chill her to the bone. The stone at the top of the cairn was marked with a single rune: Avarosa.\n\nThe assassins burst into the clearing. Ashe lifted the runestone from the cairn to defend herself, revealing something hidden underneath: an ornate bow carved from ice. She grasped it, crying out in pain as frost formed on her fingers, and tore the bow from its resting place. Cold flowed from the enchanted weapon into Ashe, awakening a tremendous power that had always lived within her.\n\nAshe turned to face the assassins. She drew the bow, and by sheer instinct, willed arrows of pure ice to form from the cold, crisp air. With a single {{ai|Volley|Ashe|frozen volley}}, she ended the insurrection. Carefully replacing the cairn stone, she gave thanks to Avarosa for her gift, and returned home. Ashe's tribe immediately recognized the legendary weapon in the archer's hand as a blessing from the ancient Freljord queen herself.\n\nWith Avarosa's bow and her vision of peaceful unification, Ashe's tribe soon swelled, becoming the largest in the Freljord. Now known as the [[File:ProfileIcon Avarosan.png|20px|link=]] Avarosan, they stand together with the belief that a united Freljord will once again become a great nation.\n\n{{sm2|Freljord- Avarosan Ashe.ogg|''&quot;It is our duty to speak of unity, here among the ruins of our past. Now our people stand divided, torn apart by ancient hatreds. Brothers and sisters, our enemy is '''not''' our neighbor. Our enemy is a land without law and a long winter's night.

We cannot be shattered.&quot;'' - {{ci|Skarner}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSkarner is an immense crystalline scorpion from a hidden valley in [[Shurima]]. Part of the ancient Brackern race, Skarner and his kin are known for their great wisdom and deep connection to the land, as their souls are fused with powerful {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|life crystals}} which hold the living thoughts and memories of their ancestors. In an age long past, the Brackern entered hibernation to avoid untold magical destruction, but recent, threatening events have roused Skarner. As the only Brackern awake, he strives to protect his kind from those who seek to harm them.\n\n==Lore==\nLong before men traversed the scorched deserts of Shurima, the very sand itself shone with primal, unchained magic. In a remote valley surrounded by steep cliffs and jagged rock formations, the age-old race of Brackern unearthed {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|raw crystals}} from deep within the sand. Each of these noble creatures fused with a single stone, which retained their consciousness long after their death.\n\nThe demise of a Brackern was a rare occurrence, as their worldly lives stretched across millennia, but even death did not signify an ending. When a creature's mortal form perished, its life stone was buried in the valley for safekeeping until a new Brackern could uncover it. This practice protected the vulnerable crystals while preserving the wisdom of the ones who came before.\n\nWith a finite number of stones, the young Brackern searched for the crystal meant for them, just as the consciousness within the stone beckoned to the Brackern it had chosen to inherit its magic and memories. In a sacred rite, the rock fused with {{ai|Crystalline Exoskeleton|Skarner|crystalline flesh}}, imbuing the creature's mind with memories and knowledge and flooding them with primal magic. A Brackern without a crystal would not long survive, for they lacked the strength, longevity, and power instilled by the stones.\n\nThe young creature named Skarner spent many years searching for the crystal meant for him. Afraid he would die before finding it, he grew more persistent in his search with each passing moon. Day and night, he delved deep into the ground, digging in a methodical pattern that covered the entire valley and neighboring hills with intricate spirals.\n\nSkarner had all but given up when he finally felt an ancient consciousness tugging at his mind. He burrowed down, venturing ever deeper until the world's heart warmed his shell. Days passed, but the consciousness grew ever more insistent as it urged him onward. Skarner's pincers closed on a well-worn stone, and he heard a rasping whisper at the back of his mind. Though the voice was faint, he already felt intimately connected to its awareness, and he knew he had found his stone.\n\nThe crystal was larger than any he had seen, and so timeworn that its glow had faded to a soft glimmer. Its surface was cracked in several places and dulled from eons buried under the ground. Skarner examined the rock with the tenderest touch, afraid of further damaging something so ancient. The dim glow within pulsed as though breathing in response to Skarner's presence.\n\nSkarner began the bonding ritual, burying himself deep underground with the crystal for weeks without sustenance. Though he ached with fatigue and his limbs atrophied in starvation, he was not afraid, for the voice within the stone comforted him. When the crystal finally fused with his body, he was overwhelmed with emotion as ancient memories and wisdom permeated his thoughts. He witnessed moments of incredible joy and crushing sorrow from generations long deceased. He felt magic all around him, suffusing his body with a deep connection to the world through a low constant hum, and sensed his kind communicating in a wordless meeting of minds.\n\nWhen the cataclysmic forces of the Rune Wars began to devastate the world, the Brackern feared the turmoil would soon mark the end of their species. They resolved to hide in hibernation until humans wiped themselves out, as it seemed certain they would. Only then would it be safe to emerge from the sands once more.\n\nThe crystalline scorpions buried themselves deep in the Shuriman desert with the youngest and most ferocious positioned closest to the surface, ready to awaken first and defend the others in case of danger. The strength Skarner gained from his ancient life stone made him more powerful than almost all of his kin, so he was one of the last of his kind to enter the long slumber.\n\nThey slept in peaceful isolation as centuries passed before Skarner awoke from his shallow burrow in a panic. Deafening explosions shattered the ground, targeting the Brackern where they lay sleeping and stunning those closest to the surface. A band of robbers had discovered the dormant creatures and were prying crystals from crystalline flesh. Skarner, protected from the brunt of the attack by his crystal, erupted from the sand in a terrible frenzy of {{ai|Crystal Slash|Skarner|sharp pincers}} and {{ai|Impale|Skarner|poisonous stabs}}. Though their numbers all but overwhelmed him, he killed many of the thieves, and the rest fled in terror. Skarner was horrified to learn he was the only one awake, and that many of his people's crystals had already been stolen.\n\nSkarner tried to revive his dormant companions, but the men had broken so many life stones in their thoughtless theft that several Brackern with damaged crystals died moments after Skarner woke them, while others would not wake at all. For weeks Skarner paced the sand above his sleeping brethren in sorrowful mourning. He was certain the crystals would quickly perish in the hands of men, and mourned their loss too.\n\nYet as the sun broke over the horizon many weeks later, Skarner heard distant echoes calling in his mind. The cries were faint, but rang clear over the land. These voices of the lost stones reached out to him in terror, imploring Skarner to reconnect them with their kind. Skarner hesitated, torn as to whether he should rescue the lost crystals or continue guarding the still-living Brackern. After weeks spent erasing all traces of the excavation, he could not stand to hear the minds of his kin suffering at the hands of the violent humans, and resolved to set out to save the missing crystals.\n\nSkarner began the arduous task of tracking the stones, hoping no others would discover his kin beneath the sand. Though his search is lonely, he occasionally hears a lost crystal calling to him, a feeling that brings joy and anguish in equal measure. He focuses his sorrow into unshakable determination, and refuses to rest until he has recovered every last life stone.\n\n;Dreamsong\nThe softskins broke our slumber of a thousand spins.\n\nFor many long ages, I sensed the world's dizzying movement. Stars exploded and died above me, though I did not see them. I felt the warmth of the sun flood the sand with life.\n\nWhen my heartpulse slowed and I curled in the dry sand to warm my body for longsleep, I thought my time below would be lonely, that the earth would not respond to my touch. But all around me were kin. I sensed them rustling in their slumber. I listened to their silent murmurs reaching for my mind. I heard their dreamsongs of worlds upon worlds. A place without softskins, without fear or pain or doubt. A place of great peace.\n\nIn the sand, we were all connected; we dreamed as one. Not just the singers, but all living things; the worms curling around smooth rockgrains, the molerats burrowing tunnels to birth their young, even a family of fur-soft spiderlings who rested for a night in the deepdark.\n\nI thought the rocks would be immobile, cold, uncaring. But they, too, were part of us. The stones were warm, and the deeper we burrowed, the closer we got to this world's wombfire. Each time the underground boiled in rage, I was there; its tremors shook the sand until I sang back with my own anger. ''We are one, we are all. Your anger is as mine.'' I heard its gratitude in the raintime when wet drops soaked the sand and the earth grew fat and full.\n\nWhen the softskins came, the ground knew only pain. Our songs became cries as we were torn and broken and scattered. I heard the sorrowsong as the softskins unearthed my kin. They tore {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|crystal namestones}} from our bodies as we screamed, louder than earthshakes, and stole them away. I sang long into the many nights, sang until my heart was empty and cold, but they did not return.\n\nToday, I am alone in the aboveplace. Today, the dry wind burns my skin. With every step, the sand grinds against me in protest. I fight my urge to bury myself down, down, to go inside the earth's deepdark. ''I am not apart. I am part of the one, not beyond.''\n\nFrom far away, a song of painfear reaches me. The tone is faint, but I recognize the melody, and I send out a song of my sorrow. A note of hope rings back in my mind, clear and fine. ''Almost, almost.''\n\nAnother set of stars whirl overhead, and again. The endlessly blinking universe stares down at me. I feel moltenheavy with the weight of above. ''I should be down, but I am here, alone in the cold air.''\n\nI have been above for three moons. A blink of an eye, a sliver of existence. A warming murmur passes silently underground - yet in the aboveplace, I feel the eternity of alone.\n\nAhead, I hear softskins. They do not sing, they shout. Their tones scratch and clash without melody or cohesion. They burn meatflesh over a falsefire. Its fat smokes the air and I choke on the stench. ''Why would they do such a thing? The ground is plenty, plenty for all.''\n\nThe melody calls to me weakly. ''Almost.'' The namestone is close.\n\nI must explain; the softskins do not understand. Their race is but three turns young; they have only begun to dig; they have barely uncoiled the beginnings of underneath. They speak, but I have not yet heard them sing. ''They will learn.''\n\nI sing in their minds a song of the calmland, so they feel the great beauty that awaits us when we sleep. I sing for my dead kin, so they know what they stole.\n\nThe softskins do not sing back. They do not seem to hear me so my voice grows louder in their heads. I sing for our namestones, wrongfully taken. ''Bring them back, they are ours. You murdered one cluster already. Do not deny our future also.'' I sing a plea. ''Let me carry the crystals to the deepdark, so they can bind with us again.'' I sing to heal this tearing wound.\n\nThe softskins are still shouting to each other. One of them releases a rhythmic sound... a laugh? I feel as though my body is being crushed by the air, so I burrow. I am comforted by the weight around me.\n\nHow can they not see the ruin they've caused? ''You are heartless, you are crude. How could you sever us like this?''\n\n{{ai|Crystalline Exoskeleton|Skarner|My husk glows skywhite}} with rage. ''I will not let these softskins destroy us.''\n\nI hear them scream as I erupt from the sand. I summon energy from the ground and store the power in my namestone. A softskin throws a splinterblade and it hits my leg, shattering on my lucent shell. ''You sing only death. I, too, can sing this song.'' I release sunbright energy and {{ai|Fracture|Skarner|sharp crystals}} burst from the ground, impaling flesh and cracking spines.\n\nThe falsefire spreads in their panic. Their crude structures of twig and hide burn through the darkness, carrying softskins into the flames. Smoke rises in an offering to the blinking stars. Softskins run from the chaos, but I am faster. I circle around them and lash out at a straggler, slicing his middle apart with {{ai|Crystal Slash|Skarner|my claw}}. I crush another underfoot. Lifeblood stains the sand. I roar in grief, not a song but a cry. ''Your blood is not worthy to touch the one and the all.''\n\nMy tail lashes left and right and I knock the softskins down. I summon the sunbright once again, and more crystals spike from the sand to pierce flesh. ''So you can hear my song, after all...''\n\nI am crude like them. I am violence. I am death.\n\nWhen I dream I see only rage. ''I am no longer worthy of the deepdark. But I cannot stop.''\n\nOnly one remains. The softskin fumbles with a glowing thing of wood and metal. ''She means to kill me.'' A false sun blazes from the thing and punctures my hardshell, burning my insides. The light reflects inside my crystal, paralyzing me. I stagger in agonizing pain. ''I cannot move. I am broken. I am ended.''\n\nA fading song rings in my mind. ''Almost, almost. We are one.''\n\nShe aims her weapon again and I shake with horror as I see the paling namestone strapped to it. ''Her weapon drains our life energy. They are wasting crystals to power their terrible song.'' I feel I will burst in fury and pain, but instead I pull strength from the ground. I cry out and lash with {{ai|Impale|Skarner|my sting}}, impaling the softskin as she writhes like a worm. I grasp the weapon and crush it with a claw.

The boy and his Yeti searched far and wide for a place they\u2019d both be welcome, and eventually found a home among the Avarosan.\n\nSometimes bonds of friendship become stronger than even bonds of blood. When those bonds link a fearless boy to a fearsome Yeti, the bond becomes a force to be reckoned with. Given the responsibility of taming a terrifying beast, Nunu forged a friendship where others would have forged chains. Now Nunu and his burly pal Willump are an inseparable pair who combine youthful exuberance and brute strength with the mythical powers of the Yeti to overcome obstacles insurmountable to any ordinary duo.\n\nNunu had only the vaguest memories of his parents or the time before he was part of the reclusive Frostguard tribe. Never welcome among his caretakers, Nunu's wanderlust and compassion often put him at odds with the tribe's elders and the boy frequently dreamed of places far beyond the shadow of the Frostguard citadel. Sometimes he would do more than just dream, much to the frustration of his minders. This was never more apparent than when Nunu was apprenticed to the tribe's beast master and charged with the care of the creatures under his yoke.\n\nThe Frostguard held a menagerie of the [[Freljord|Freljord's]] wildlife at their beck and call, but unique among their collection was the Yeti: an uncommon creature with mystical qualities and raw physical strength. The beastmaster taught Nunu that it was only a lean diet of plants and regular whippings that kept the vicious beast tame, but the more time Nunu spent caring for the creature, the more he learned that the Yeti was no feral monster.\n\nAs he saw his new friend Willump growing weaker and sicker, Nunu began to sneak the Yeti scraps of meat, hoping to restore his health. Day by day, Willump grew stronger and not the slightest bit savage contrary to the beastmaster's claims. Nunu had hopes of convincing him that the Yeti possessed no danger, but it wasn't meant to be. The next time Nunu came to deliver Willump a meal, he found the Yeti's cage shattered,with only a crude drawing inside signaling the Yeti's farewell. Without hesitation, Nunu rushed into the wilderness in search of his friend.\n\nWhen Nunu finally caught up to Willump, he found the Yeti cornered by the beastmaster alongside a group of Frostguard warriors. Afraid that the men would hurt his friend, Nunu threw himself between the Yeti and the beastmaster's lash, but the brutal man would not stay his hand. As the furious beastmaster raised his whip once more, the Yeti swelled up with uncharacteristic fury. Even after so much mistreatment, it wasn't concern for himself but for the boy who'd shown him kindness that finally pushed Willump too far. The Yeti raged and left the man bloodied in the snow.\n\nTerrified by Willump's fury, the remaining Frostguard warriors fled. Nunu realized there was no going back. He yelled at Willump to run before the men returned to kill him, but the Yeti refused to leave the young boy. Nunu was faced with a hard choice: abandon his sole friend and lead a life of captivity with the Frostguard,or strike out into the harsh wilds and leave behind the only home he knew. Nunu chose the only path that made sense. Leaping onto the back of the mighty Yeti, Nunu joined Willump in his great escape.

Though he chooses to enter into violence as a last resort, the {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|grace}} and {{ai|Double Strike|Master Yi|speed}} with which he wields {{ai|Highlander|Master Yi|his blade}} ensures resolution is always swift. As the last living practitioner of Wuju, Master Yi has devoted his life to finding able pupils to carry on the legacy of his lost people.\n\nEven before Yi mastered Wuju, he was considered one of the most skilled practitioners of the mystical martial art. He would soon prove his mastery when word of a massive [[Noxus|Noxian]] invasion reached his remote village. Yi swept across the battlefields of [[Ionia]], turning back the tide of Noxus' vast infantry with {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|swift}} and {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|deadly}} strikes, much to the embarrassment of the Noxian High Command.\n\nRecognizing the threat the Wuju disciples posed to their invasion, the Noxians chose to unleash a nightmarish {{ci|Singed|chemical attack}} on the home of the deadly art. Those who somehow survived the poisonous concoction had their minds twisted beyond repair. Yi's home was left in ruin.\n\nAt the war's conclusion, Yi returned to the grotesque remains of his village. There he became the attack's final casualty. Slain in spirit, if not in body, Yi clung to the only feeling left within his heart: vengeance. Driven only by his desire to punish those who'd destroyed his home, Yi spent years training in seclusion.\n\nHe became a deadlier swordsman than he had ever been, but true mastery of Wuju still eluded him. At the height of Yi's frustration, {{ci|Wukong|a monkey}} of unusually noble bearing interrupted his training.\n\nStanding as straight and tall as a man, the monkey watched and mimicked Yi's movements. Yi shooed the monkey away, but the agile creature took great amusement in turning Yi's own techniques against him.\n\nGradually, Yi felt his anger subside as he sparred with the playful animal, and when the burden of his hatred had fully lifted, he found he had caught the monkey by his tail. Yi then understood that he would never master Wuju so long as he pursued it for vengeance, and as he let go of the monkey, he also released his desire to shed his enemy's blood.\n\nYi thanked the monkey for showing him what he'd been blind to, and was surprised when the creature actually replied. He wished to learn Yi's art of fighting.\n\nIt was an odd request, but through it Yi saw his new path: the way to honor the memory of his lost people was to pass their teachings on to a new generation.\n\n", "id": 11}, "Elise": {"key": "Elise", "name": "Elise", "title": "the Spider Queen", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Elise\n|real_name = Elise Kythera Zaavan\n|alias = \n* The Spider Queen\n* &lt;s&gt;Lady Elise&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|Spiderlings}}\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|render = Elise Render.png\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Shapeshifter)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Immortal Bastion, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* House Zaavan Mistress\n* Artifact Collector\n* {{moi|Vilemaw}}'s High Priestess and Feeder &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36346739#36346739 kitae on Vilemaw]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] [[The Black Rose]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Vilemaw\n|friends = LeBlanc, Vladimir\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/elise?_k=h7d851 Spider Queen]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Beauty is power too, and can strike swifter than any sword.&quot;'' - {{ci|Elise}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nElise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep in the Immortal Bastion of [[Noxus]]. Once she was mortal, the mistress of a once-powerful house, but the bite of a vile {{moi|Vilemaw|spider god}} transformed her into something beautiful, undying, and utterly inhuman. To maintain her eternal youth, Elise preys upon the innocent, and there are few who can resist her seductions.\n\n==Lore==\nThe Lady Elise was born many centuries ago to House Kythera, an old and powerful family of Noxus, and swiftly learned the power of beauty to influence the weak-minded. When she came of age, she plotted to marry the scion of House Zaavan to augment her house's power. The match was opposed by many within Zaavan, but Elise beguiled her intended husband and manipulated her detractors to secure a betrothal.\n\nAs Elise had planned, her influence upon her new husband proved considerable. House Zaavan grew stronger, which in turn saw House Kythera's star rise. Elise's husband was the face of his house, but those in the know understood who truly wielded power. At first, Elise's husband tolerated this, but as the years went by, his discontent festered as he became a light joke among Noxian families.\n\nEventually, his resentment grew ever more rancorous until one night over a typically frosty dinner, he revealed he had tainted her wine with a disfiguring poison. He offered his terms; withdraw from society and stay out of his way as he took up the reins of power and he would give her the antidote. Refuse, and he would watch her die slowly and painfully. With every breath the poison did its evil work, dissolving her flesh and bone from the inside out. Believing he would have the antidote somewhere about his person, Elise palmed a sharp knife and played the role of remorseful wife to the hilt. She wept and begged her husband to forgive her, using every wile in her arsenal to approach without alerting him to her deadly intent. All the while, the poison was wracking her body, discoloring her flesh with grotesque lesions and filling her limbs with agony.\n\nWhen Elise reached her husband, he realized - too late - just how badly he had underestimated her disdain. She leapt upon him and rammed the knife through his heart, twisting the blade slowly as she watched him die. Elise found and drank the antidote, but the damage was done. Her face was monstrously disfigured with grotesque weals and necrotic flesh, like a cadaver given hideous animation.\n\nElise was now mistress of House Zaavan, and such was the nature of Noxian politics that she was lauded for cutting a weakness from the empire. Yet so entwined were her particular notions of beauty and power that she retreated from public life and took to wearing a face-covering veil. Eschewing daylight, and turning away all allies and petitioners from her door, her once powerful house began a slow descent into obscurity. Elise roamed the empty halls of her palace in isolation and became a denizen of darkness, only ever venturing beyond its high walls at night.\n\nOn one of her midnight wanderings, Elise was approached by another veiled woman, who pressed a waxen sigil of a [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] Black Rose into her palm and whispered that {{ci|LeBlanc|the Pale Woman}} would greatly value her talents. Elise pressed on, but as she walked away, the woman's voice echoed after her with the promise of being made whole again. However absurd she told herself it was, vanity and the hope of her beauty being renewed drove Elise to investigate further. She prowled the streets for weeks until she saw [[the Black Rose]] sigil again, etched onto a shadowed archway leading into the catacombs beneath Noxus.\n\nFollowing the hidden sigils brought her to the Black Rose, a secret society where those who dabbled in the darker powers of magic shared hidden knowledge and secrets. Elise became a regular visitor, going unveiled among its members and swiftly establishing a close rapport with the Pale Woman, an agelessly beautiful individual of great power. Elise embraced the society's ways, but always sought the gift she had been promised; her beauty made whole again.\n\nThe Pale Woman spoke of a haunted place known as the [[Shadow Isles]] and a serpent-bladed {{w|athame}} belonging to one of her acolytes who had been slain in the lair of a voracious {{moi|Vilemaw|spider god}}. The dagger was imbued with powerful magic, and if it was returned to her, then she would use its magic to restore Elise's beauty. Elise immediately accepted and led a group of Black Rose devotees to the shunned island, knowing there would be a blood price to pay for such a prize.\n\nElise found a desperate, debt-ridden captain willing to bear her and her fellow pilgrims across the ocean. The ship sailed for weeks until a craggy island loomed from seething banks of black mist. Elise came ashore on a beach of ashen sand and led her followers deep into the island's haunted depths like lambs to the slaughter. Many were stolen away by spiteful wraiths, but half a dozen remained by the time they reached the web-wreathed lair of the Spider God.\n\nA bloated, monstrous creature of chitin and fangs erupted from the darkness and feasted on the screaming men and women. As they died or were swept up in streams of web, Elise saw the dagger the Pale Woman sought - held in the grip of a desiccated corpse. She snatched it up as the Spider God sank its envenomed fangs into her shoulder. Elise fell forward and the blade of the athame pierced her heart, its powerful magic flooding her and mixing with the lethal venom to wreak terrible changes on her body. Elise was transformed as the magically-empowered venom renewed her flesh, transforming it into a form even more beautiful than before. Her scars vanished and her skin became flawless and porcelain smooth, but the god's venom had ambitions of its own. Elise's back writhed with undulant motion as a host of arachnoid legs pushed their way from her flesh.\n\nElise rose, breathless with the agony of her transformation, to find the Spider God looming above her. Shared power flowed between them, and both immediately sensed how they might benefit from this unexpected symbiosis. Elise returned to her ship, untroubled by the island's spirits, and set sail for Noxus. When her ship arrived at the docks in the dead of night, Elise was the only living thing aboard.\n\nElise returned the athame to the leader of the Black Rose, though the Pale Woman warned that the magic maintaining her restored beauty would eventually fade. The two sealed a pact; the Black Rose would provide Elise with acolytes to offer up to the Spider God, and she in turn, would return any artifacts of power she discovered upon the isles.\n\nElise once again took up residence in the neglected halls of House Zaavan, becoming known as a beautiful yet unreachable recluse. None suspected her true nature, yet fanciful rumors cling to her, wild tales of her immortal beauty and a terrifying creature said to lair high in her dilapidated, dust-wreathed palace.\n\nCenturies have passed since her first voyage to the Shadow Isles, and whenever Elise sees streaks of white in her hair or crow's feet at her eyes, she ventures forth to cull easily swayed souls from the Black Rose and set sail for the isle of black mists. None who accompany her ever return, and with each voyage, it is said she is renewed and invigorated, bearing another ancient artifact for the Pale Woman.\n\n;Strand by Silken Strand\nThe weeks spent on the ocean had made Markus feel dizzy and weak, so he was glad to be back on dry land. The path leading from the basalt shore had a slick, oily quality, making it treacherous underfoot. The crooked trees to either side were wretched, blackened husks that wept yellowed sap from where it looked like some panicked animal had clawed them ragged. Soft light shimmered between the trees, dancing like the corpse candles that flickered over marshland and drew unwary souls to their doom. The branches were hung with what looked like canopies of ragged muslin, and it took Markus a moment to realize they were swathes of cobwebs.\n\nWiry bracken clogged the undergrowth on either side of the path, rustling with the motion of unseen creatures shadowing their passage through the forest. Perhaps the rats infesting the ship had followed them. Markus had never caught sight of one, beyond a fleeting glimpse of a swollen, {{ai|Spider Form|Elise|black-furred body}} or the skittering sound of {{ai|Skittering Frenzy|Elise|claws}} on wood. He'd never been able to shake the notion that it sounded as if these rats had a few {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|too many legs}} than any normal rat should have.\n\nThe island's air was heavy with damp, and his finely tailored tunic and boots were sodden with clinging moisture. He held a scented pomander beneath his nose, but it did little to disguise the stench of the island, reminding him of the charnel pits beyond the walls of [[Noxus]] when the winds blew in from the ocean. Thinking back to his homeland, he felt a brief twinge of unease. The revels in the catacombs far beneath the city had been a deliciously illicit thrill, a reward for following the secret symbol of the [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] black-petaled bloom. Within the darkened sepulchers, he and his fellows gathered as devotees.\n\nWhere ''she'' awaited.\n\nHe looked ahead, hoping for a glimpse of the beguiling woman whose words had brought so many of them to this place. He caught a flash of crimson silk and swaying hips before the mist oozing between the trees obscured his sight of her. He'd thrilled to the sermons of her ancient god, and had been overjoyed when he and the others had been chosen to join her on this pilgrimage. It seemed like a grand adventure when they boarded the heavily laden barque at midnight, under the still gaze of the mute and hooded steersman, but being so far from Noxus had begun to dull his enthusiasm.\n\nMarkus paused and turned to look back along the path. His fellow pilgrims pushed past, like vacant-eyed cattle en route to the slaughterman's hammer. ''What was wrong with them?'' Behind them came the steersman, gliding over the path as though his feet barely touched it. His robes were undulant with motion and suffocating fear flowered in Markus' breast at the thought of being near this repellent figure.\n\nHe turned away, only to find himself face to face with ''her''.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Elise}}... &quot;'' he said, and the breath caught in his throat. He instinctively wanted to push her away and flee this awful place, but the intoxication of her dark beauty overpowered any thought of rejection. His sense of revulsion passed so swiftly he wasn't even sure he'd truly felt it.\n\n''&quot;Markus&quot;'', she said, and the sound of his name on her lips was divine, sending a surge of pleasure down his spine. Her beauty transfixed him, and he savored every detail of her perfect form. Her features were angular and sharp, framed by lustrous crimson hair, like that of a highborn girl he once knew. Full lips and eyes of dark radiance drew him deeper into her web with the promise of raptures yet to come. A cloak of sable, secured by an eight-pronged brooch, mantled her rounded shoulders. It rippled with motion, though there was no wind to stir it.\n\n''&quot;Is something the matter, Markus?&quot;'' she said. Her smoky tones soothed his fear like a balm. ''&quot;I need you to be at peace. You are at peace, aren't you, Markus?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Yes, Elise&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;I am at peace.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Good. It would make me unhappy to know you were not at peace when we are so close.&quot;''\n\nThe thought of displeasing her sent a jolt of panic through Markus and he dropped to the ground. He wrapped his arms around her legs, her limbs slender and alabaster white, smooth and cold to the touch.\n\n''&quot;Anything for you, mistress&quot;'', he said.\n\nShe looked down on him and smiled. For an instant Markus thought he saw something long, thin and glossy shift beneath her cloak. The motion was sickening and unnatural, but he didn't care. She hooked a sharpened, obsidian-black fingernail under his chin and drew him to his feet. A rivulet of blood ran down his neck, but he ignored it as she turned and led him onward.\n\nHe willingly followed, all thoughts save pleasing her vanishing like wind-blown smoke. The trees thinned out and the path ended before a rocky cliff carved with time-weathered symbols that made his eyes sting. A shadowed cave gaped like a vile maw at the base of the cliff, and Markus felt his certainty waver as a sudden sense of dread uncoiled in his gut.\n\nElise beckoned him inside, and he was powerless to resist.\n\nThe interior of the cave was unnaturally dark and stiflingly warm, a clammy, fever heat that reeked like offal swept from a butcher's block. A voice deep inside was screaming at him to run, to get as far from this hideous place as possible, but his traitorous feet carried him still deeper into the cave. A droplet from somewhere high above landed on his cheek and he flinched at the sudden, burning pain of it. He looked up at the cavern roof, seeing pale, grub-like shapes hanging overhead and swaying with frantic, trapped motion. In the translucent surface of the fresh-spun web, a human face screamed in mute horror against the suffocating, silken net.\n\n''&quot;What is this place?&quot;'' he asked, the veils of deceit woven around him falling away.\n\n''&quot;This is my temple, Markus&quot;'', said Elise, reaching up to unfasten the eight-pronged brooch at her shoulder and letting her cloak fall away. ''&quot;This is the lair of the {{moi|Vilemaw|Spider God}}.&quot;''\n\nHer shoulders squirmed as two pairs of slender, chitinous limbs unfolded from the flesh of her back; long, dark and tapering to razored talons. They lifted Elise up as a grotesque, bloated mass shifted in the darkness behind her. Colossal legs heaved its corrupt body forward, the faint light from beyond the cave reflecting on the myriad facets of its eyes.\n\nThe vast spider's bulk was enormous, furred and scabbed with wet, mutant growths. The terror of its nightmarish appearance shattered the last of Elise's hold on Markus, and he fled toward the cave mouth with her cruel laughter ringing in his ears. Ropes of {{ai|Cocoon|Elise|sticky web}} struck the rock beside him. Glutinous strands struck his flailing limbs and his pace slowed as he became more and more entangled. He heard the clicking of clawed limbs in pursuit and wept at the thought of her touching him. Yet more strands of her web snared him as something sharp stabbed his shoulder with astonishing swiftness. Markus fell to his knees, {{ai|Neurotoxin|Elise|paralyzing venom}} spreading through his body and locking him in a prison of his own flesh.\n\nA shadow fell across him and he saw the mute steersman with his arms outstretched. Markus screamed as the steersman's hooded robe collapsed, revealing that this was not a man at all, but a writhing nest of innumerable {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|spiders}} given the semblance of a man.

When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus's elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds.

As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general, many paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade.\n\nRigorously trained by the finest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking [[Demacia]]n officer.\n\nAs she set to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night.\n\nKatarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nFurious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task.

He has existed for countless centuries, shielded from true death by necromantic sorcery and the force of his own dark will. Those who dare face Mordekaiser in battle risk {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|a horrific curse}}: he enslaves his victims' souls to become instruments of destruction.\n\n==Lore==\nMordekaiser was once mortal, a brutal warlord-king who ruled the lands of eastern [[Valoran]] long before the rise of [[Demacia]] or [[Noxus]]. He waded into battle bedecked in heavy iron armor and slaughtered all who opposed him, crushing them beneath his ensorcelled mace, {{ai|Mace of Spades|Mordekaiser|Nightfall}}.\n\nAs hated as he was feared, his enemies finally rallied to end his dark reign. After a long and bloody day of battle, Mordekaiser met his fate standing atop a mountain of corpses, surrounded by his foes. He laughed even as he died, pierced by arrows, swords and spears, promising his killers that he would come back for them.\n\nHis body was hurled upon an immense pyre amid great celebration from his enemies. While the flames were unable to do more than blacken his armor, Mordekaiser's body was reduced to charred bones.\n\nThe fires burned for days on end, but as they finally died down and the victors moved on, a coterie of sorcerers slunk forward and sifted through the ashes, gathering up Mordekaiser's armor and bones. They bore them away in secret, and on a moonless night they laid the skeleton upon a rune-carved slab and enacted a spell of vile, necromantic sorcery. As their dark magicks reached a crescendo, a shadowy form appeared upon the slab. The deathly shade rose to its feet, leaving the skeleton behind.\n\nIt was a wraith formed of pure darkness, yet its eyes burned with malice. The fire-blackened pieces of armor slammed into place around the shadowy spirit, as if drawn to a powerful lodestone, and the sorcerers dropped to their knees before their risen master. They had been promised great power for their service, but had not foreseen how they were to be rewarded.\n\nWith newfound mastery over the necromantic arts, Mordekaiser gifted the sorcerers with undeath, trapping them between life and death. They became vile liches, living corpses cursed to serve him until the end of time.\n\nOver the next decade Mordekaiser saw all those who had defied him slain. {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|He cursed them}} into eternal servitude, drawing out their souls and forcing them to obey his undying will.\n\nHaving assumed the mantle of the Iron Revenant, Mordekaiser's nightmarish reign of darkness lasted many centuries. Several times he was seemingly slain during this period, yet always he returned, brought back by the power of his soul-bound liches.\n\nMordekaiser's bones were key to his unholy reincarnation, and as the centuries rolled on he became increasingly paranoid about their safety. He constructed a monolithic fortress at the heart of his empire that came to be known as the Immortal Bastion. Locked away at the core of this epic stronghold he hid his remains.\n\nThe Immortal Bastion was eventually besieged by a concentrated alliance of tribes and warbands. During the siege, an unknown thief infiltrated the mighty fortress, bypassing its fiendish defenses to steal Mordekaiser's skull. His skeleton needed to be complete in order for his resurrection to be enacted, yet fearful of their master's wrath, his enslaved liches kept the theft a secret.\n\nOn the walls of the Immortal Bastion, countless enemies fell before Mordekaiser, yet it was not enough to stave off defeat. His fortress was overrun and he was dragged down by sheer weight of numbers. His deadly mace was torn from his grasp and great chains wrapped around his limbs. The booming of his laughter echoed through the darkness - he had no reason not to believe he would be reborn anew, as he had been many times before. The chains binding him were hitched to hulking Basilisks, and with a barked order the immense scaled beasts ripped him apart.\n\nMordekaiser's skull was taken across the sea to the Blessed Isles, a land hidden in mist and legend. The wise adepts of that land knew of Mordekaiser, and of his weakness. They had stolen his skull in order to rid the world of his unholy presence, placing it in a vault deep beneath the ground, secured behind locks and magical wards. Mordekaiser's servants were scattered to the corners of the world, seeking his lost skull, but were always unable to locate it. It seemed Mordekaiser's reign was truly over.\n\nYears rolled into decades, decades to centuries, until a cataclysm was unleashed upon the Blessed Isles. {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|A king}} whose mind had been ruined by grief and madness unleashed a terrible spell that condemned the isles to darkness, turning them into a twisted realm of the undying - the Shadow Isles. During that great sorcerous explosion, the vaults securing Mordekaiser's skull were torn asunder.\n\nDrawn like moths to a flame, Mordekaiser's liches made their way to the newly born Shadow Isles. They bore with them their master's bones, and digging his skull from the ruins, were finally able to unleash him upon the world once more.\n\nMordekaiser has since carved out his own empire upon the Shadow Isles, enslaving a growing army of the dead. He looks down upon these newly formed undying spirits as a lesser breed, for he chose his path freely, while these others are merely lost souls. Nevertheless, he sees their use; they will be his foot-soldiers in the conflicts to come.\n\nUnlike the lesser spirits, Mordekaiser is not bound by [[the Black Mist]] - he is too powerful for that - yet its baleful energy grants him considerable power. For now at least, the Shadow Isles serves as the perfect place to build his strength.\n\nWhile he consolidates his power, and constantly obsesses over making his bones ever-more secure, Mordekaiser has begun to look across the seas, towards Valoran. He has set his sights on the empires and civilizations that have risen since his absence. In particular, his attention is drawn to the Immortal Bastion, that mighty fortress that now acts as the capital city of the upstart empire called Noxus.\n\nA new era of darkness beckons.\n\n;Shadows of Damnation\n[[The Black Mist]] coiled and twisted like a living creature as it rolled forward to encircle the isolated, grey-stoned castle.\n\nA massive, armored figure walked within the darkness of the Black Mist. His heavy warplate gleamed like oil, and orbs of cruel witchfire burned within his horned helm.\n\nGrass withered underfoot as the armored revenant marched towards the castle's gatehouse. He could see movement on the walls. They knew death had come for them.\n\nHis own name drifted on the wind, whispered in fear:\n\n''{{ci|Mordekaiser}}.''\n\nArrows sliced through the night. Several stuck Mordekaiser, ricocheting from his armor. One sank into the gap between his helm and gorget, but his inexorable approach did not slow.\n\nA heavy iron portcullis barred Mordekaiser's advance. The revenant extended a gauntleted hand and made a wrenching motion in the air. The lattice ironwork screamed in protest as it was twisted out of shape before being hurled contemptuously aside, revealing the heavy oak gate beyond.\n\nWhite hot warding runes burst to life upon the gate, forcing Mordekaiser back half a step. The Black Mist roiled around him, and it was possible now for the defenders to see other forms within it - hateful, shadowy specters that hungered for living souls.\n\nMordekaiser stepped forward, brandishing his immense spiked mace, {{ai|Mace of Spades|Mordekaiser|Nightfall}}. A weapon of dark renown, thousands had fallen before it. With a powerful swing, he slammed the weapon into the oak gate.\n\nThe runes exploded, Mordekaiser's dark sorcery overcoming the petty protective spells of his enemies. The gate smashed inwards, ripped off its hinges.\n\nThe Black Mist flowed through the breach, Mordekaiser striding within it.\n\nThe garrisoned soldiers and men-at-arms waited for him in the courtyard beyond.\n\n''Weaklings all.'' His gaze swept over them as he sought a foe worthy of his attention. His undying gaze settled on a silver-clad knight that stepped out to meet him, sword drawn.\n\n''&quot;Begone, revenant, or I shall see you banished&quot;'', said the knight. ''&quot;This hamlet and its people are under my protection.&quot;''\n\nRising to this threat, a host of specters and translucent warriors manifested in the Black Mist behind their master.\n\n''&quot;This one's soul is mine&quot;'', Mordekaiser said, holding the eager spirits at bay. His voice was deep and sepulchral, the timbre of death itself.\n\nMordekaiser pointed, and {{ai|Siphon of Destruction|Mordekaiser|a cone of malignant unlife}} burst towards the knight.\n\nThe knight's armor shone brightly for a second, then returned to its normal, mundane form, leaving him unharmed by Mordekaiser's necromantic sorcery.\n\n''&quot;[[Demacia]]n steel&quot;'', sneered Mordekaiser. ''&quot;It will not save you.&quot;''\n\nHe stepped forward and brought his spiked mace down toward the knight's skull. The strike was met with a two-handed parry, though the power of it forced the knight to his knees. Mordekaiser towered over him.\n\nThe knight spun away, avoiding Nightfall as it swung toward him in a lethal arc. He sidestepped and sank his blade deep into Mordekaiser's side, biting through the banded links and chain. To a living man, it would have been a mortal blow, but to the armored behemoth, it was as nothing. Mordekaiser backhanded the knight across the side of his head, sending him reeling.\n\nThe Iron Revenant stepped in to end the fight, but the knight turned aside his strike with exquisite skill, and rammed the point of his blade into Mordekaiser's chest with all his strength and weight.\n\nWith a wrench of metal, the blade punched through the breastplate above the heart. There was no resistance from within, as if the suit were hollow.\n\nMordekaiser grabbed the knight by the throat in one giant hand and lifted him off the ground.\n\n''&quot;You thought you could protect these mortals&quot;'', said Mordekaiser. ''&quot;But know that it will be you who slays them.&quot;''\n\nHe squeezed, tightening his grip on the knight's throat. The mortal's feet kicked in the air. Mordekaiser watched closely, eyes burning, as the life drained from the knight. Finally, he dropped the lifeless corpse to the floor.\n\nMordekaiser knelt and placed a hand upon the dead knight's chest. When the armored giant rose, he drew forth {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|the shade}} of the dead warrior.\n\nThe spirit of the knight looked around it, horror writ in its spectral eyes.\n\n''&quot;Now&quot;'', commanded Mordekaiser, knowing that the shade was powerless to resist him.\n\n''&quot;Kill them all.&quot;''\n\n", "id": 82}, "KogMaw": {"key": "KogMaw", "name": "Kog'Maw", "title": "the Mouth of the Abyss", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kog'Maw\n|alias = The Mouth of the Abyss\n|render = Kog'Maw Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[The Void|Voidborn]] &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Predator \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution|Battlecast]] Member {{w|Alternate future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Malzahar, Kha'Zix, Cho'Gath\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast Army]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;If that's just hungry, I don't want to see angry.&quot;'' - {{ci|Tryndamere}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWhen the prophet {{ci|Malzahar}} was reborn in [[Icathia]], he was led there by an ominous voice which thereafter anchored itself to his psyche.\n\nFrom within, this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though Malzahar was no longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons.\n\nThis baleful beacon's gentle flicker - now fastened to [[Runeterra]] - drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between spaces which were never meant to meet.\n\nThere amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, {{ci|Kog'Maw}} manifested in [[Valoran]] with unsettling curiosity.

He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\n\nThe earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Protectorate and the [[File:ProfileIcon713 Red Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Magelords. Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped. They braced for inevitable defeat.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words, he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. His presence inspired the desperate warriors. At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies, his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon, the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.\n\n[[File:Aatrox Statuesketch.png|left|180px]]\n\nAatrox vanished after that battle, but the Protectorate army's newfound fury did not. Their surprising triumph led to many more until they were able to finally return home victorious. Their countrymen hailed them as heroes, but though they had saved their entire civilization from destruction, darkness lingered in the mind of each warrior. Something within them had changed. Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.\n\nTales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\n\n", "id": 266}, "Draven": {"key": "Draven", "name": "Draven", "title": "the Glorious Executioner", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Draven\n|alias = \n* The Glorious Executioner\n* Draaaaven\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven|Spinning Axes}}\n|render = Draven Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Executioner\n* &lt;small&gt;(News Reporter {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = Draven\n|friends = Darius, Draven\n|rivals = Darius\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The 'best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.&quot;'' - {{ci|Draven}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nUnlike his brother {{ci|Darius}}, victory in battle was never enough for Draven.

Just before the man managed to flee from sight, Draven brought him down with a flawless throw of {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven|his axe}}.\n\nSoon, all of Draven's executions became a gauntlet through which Noxian prisoners raced for a final chance at life. He used this trial as his own personal stage, and turned executions into a leading form of entertainment. He rallied onlookers into a frenzy, while desperate prisoners scrambled to evade him. They never succeeded. Rejecting the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright outfits and developed {{ai|Whirling Death|Draven|flashy signature moves}} to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. \n\nAs his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center of attention. Before long, the scope of his ambitions outgrew the population of Noxus. He decided that the glorious exploits of Draven should be put on display for [[Runeterra|the entire world]].\n\n", "id": 119}, "TahmKench": {"key": "TahmKench", "name": "Tahm Kench", "title": "the River King", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Tahm Kench\n|real_name    = Tahm Kench &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Name taken from a Gambler)&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Tahm Kench Render.png|link=|260px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = River Demon &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/MsX2i6Vd-jaredanriot-what-is-tahm-kench-exactly?comment=0006 Tahm a River Demon]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|birthplace   = Ancient [[Runeterra]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Runeterra]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Crossroads Demon \n* &lt;small&gt;(Master Chef{{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Aatrox\n|rivals       = Teemo, Heimerdinger, Tristana, Fizz, Ziggs, Kennen, Lulu, Rumble, Corki, Poppy, Gnar\n|related      = *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9RM4HwwoKs The River King]\n*[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-reveal/tahm-kench-river-king Champion Reveal: Tahm Kench]\n*[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/u78pishu-the-tahm-kench-cookbook The Tahm Kench Cookbook]\n|disp_name = Tahm Kench\n|alias        = * The River King\n* Demon\n}}\nTahm Kench travels Runeterra's waterways, feeding his insatiable appetite with the misery of the unsuspecting.

They ain't never got a seat for me. So I need men, like yourself, and let me in.&quot;''\n\n''Now the Gambler's only hunger was dice and cards. So this bargain?

His is a cautionary tale of power run amok, taught to all summoners within [[the League]]. Decades ago, there existed a powerful rune mage from [[Zaun]] - Istvaan. At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of [[the League]]'s first [[summoner]]s. Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.\n\nWhat exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in [[Summoner's Rift]]. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were {{ai|Terrify|Fiddlesticks|driven mad by fear}}, mere husks of men gibbering about {{ai|Crowstorm|Fiddlesticks|crows}} and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy. Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the [[Fields of Justice]], what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown. His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand before him.\n\n", "id": 9}, "Pantheon": {"key": "Pantheon", "name": "Pantheon", "title": "the Artisan of War", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Pantheon\n|real_name    = Atreus &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Possessed body's name)&lt;/small&gt;\n|alias        = * The Artisan of War\n* Celestial Aspect of War\n* Aspect of the Warrior\n|render       = [[File:Pantheon Render.png|link=|280px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = &lt;s&gt;Rakkor Tribe&lt;/s&gt;, [[Mount Targon]] &lt;small&gt;(Ancient times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * &lt;s&gt;Rakkor Warrior&lt;/s&gt;\n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(War)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(A Baker{{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Mount_Targon_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;[[Mount Targon|The Rakkor]]&lt;/s&gt;\n|allies       = Aurelion Sol\n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Leona\n|enemies      = \n|related      = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/pantheon.html Artisan of War]\n}}\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Bring forth one true champion, or a hundred more like you, and then we shall have a battle that will be spoken of until the end of time.&quot;'' - {{ci|Pantheon}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n", "background": "he peerless warrior known as Pantheon is a nigh-unstoppable paragon of battle. He was born among the Rakkor, a warlike people living on the flanks of Mount Targon, and after climbing the mountain's treacherous peak and being deemed worthy, he was chosen to become the earthly incarnation of the celestial Aspect of War. Imbued with inhuman power, he relentlessly seeks the enemies of Targon, leaving only corpses in his wake.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nAtreus was a proud young Rakkoran named after one of the four stars that formed the Warrior constellation in the night sky \u2013 the constellation known to the Rakkor as the Pantheon. While not the fastest or strongest of the young warriors of Mount Targon, nor the most skilled with the bow, spear or blade, Atreus was determined, single-minded, and his endurance was legendary among his peers. Every day before dawn, while the others slept, he rose to run the treacherous paths of Mount Targon, and he was ever the last to leave the training ground at night, his arms leaden from blade-work. \n\nA fierce rivalry developed between Atreus and another young Rakkoran, a boy called Pylas. Born into a line of renowned warriors, Pylas was skillful, strong, and popular. He seemed destined for greatness, and none his age could best him in the fighting circle. Only Atreus refused to back down, pushing himself up from the ground to fight on, bloodied and bruised, even after being knocked down again and again. While this earned Atreus the respect of his grizzled instructors, it gained him the enmity of Pylas, who took Atreus\u2019s unrelenting defiance as a lack of respect. \nAtreus was shunned by his peers and suffered numerous beatings from Pylas and his followers, though he endured it all with stoic resilience. He kept his growing ostracism a secret from his family, knowing it would only cause them pain. \nOn an early winter patrol, a day\u2019s march from their village, the young warriors and their trainers came upon the smoking ruin of a Rakkoran outpost. Blood stained the snow, and bodies lay strewn across the ground. A hasty retreat was ordered, but it was too late\u2026 the enemy was already upon them. \n\nClad in furs and heavy iron armor, the outsiders sprang from beneath the snow, axes flashing in the cold light. None of the young warriors had completed their training, and their superiors were all greybeards, well past their prime, yet several enemies were slain for every one of their own that fell. Nevertheless, the outsiders outnumbered them, and the Rakkor were cut down, one by one. \n\nPylas and Atreus fought back to back, the last of the Rakkor still standing. Both were injured and bleeding. The battle would be over in moments, yet they knew they had to warn the village. Atreus plunged his spear into a barbarian\u2019s throat, while Pylas cut down two more, creating a momentary gap in the circle of enemies. Atreus told Pylas to go, saying that he would hold their enemies off so Pylas could get away. With no time to argue \u2013 Atreus was already charging the enemy \u2013 Pylas ran. \n\nAtreus fought hard, but as a heavy axe slammed into his chest, he finally fell, and slipped into unconsciousness. \nAtreus awoke, not in the celestial afterlife as he had expected, but upon the mountain where he had fallen. The sun had dropped behind the surrounding peaks, and a fresh layer of snow covered him. Numb and barely lucid, he pushed himself to his feet. He picked his way between the bodies of the fallen Rakkor, but all were dead. Worse, Pylas lay some way off, a throwing axe embedded in his back. Word had not reached their village. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-stumbling to Pylas\u2019s side, Atreus found his one-time rival alive, but horribly wounded. Hefting the young warrior to his shoulders, Atreus began the long trek home. Three days later, he stumbled to the outskirts of their village, and finally allowed himself to collapse. \n\nHe awoke to find Pylas watching over him, and his wounds stitched and bound. While Atreus was relieved to find that their village had not been attacked, he was also surprised to learn that neither the Rakkor nor the Solari elders had sent out the Ra-Horak to find and kill the intruders, choosing instead to stay and defend against any possible attack. \n\nIn the months that followed, Atreus and Pylas became close friends. All earlier antagonism forgotten, they threw themselves into their training with renewed vigor and purpose. All the while, Atreus\u2019s resentment toward the Solari order grew. He felt the best way to protect the Rakkor was to actively seek out and destroy their would-be enemies, but the new leader of the Solari\u2019s warriors \u2013 a former member of his own tribe, Leona \u2013 preached a different form of protection, which Atreus felt was weak and passive. \n\nAs with all young Rakkorans, Atreus and Pylas had grown up hearing stories of great heroes climbing to the peak of Mount Targon and being blessed with great power. Having passed the arduous Rakkoran warrior rites together, the pair began to train in earnest toward making the ascent themselves. Atreus hoped to gain the power he would need to seek out and defeat the enemies of the Rakkor himself, since it seemed the Solari were not willing to do so. \nOnly the strongest attempted the climb, and fewer than one in a thousand even glimpsed the peak. Nevertheless, Atreus and Pylas joined a larger group gathered from all the Rakkoran villages scattered around the foothills of the mountain, and began the ascent. As they set off, the sun turned dark as the silver moon passed before it. Some saw this as an ill omen, but Atreus took it as a sign he was on the right path \u2013 that his beliefs about the Solari were correct.\n \nAfter weeks of climbing, the group was half its original size. Some had turned back, while others had been claimed by the mountain, having fallen into crevasses, been buried beneath avalanches, or frozen to death in the night. They were high above the cloud line, and the sky was filled with strange shifting lights and illusions. Still they pressed on. \n\nThe air grew steadily thinner, and the cold ever more bitter as the weeks turned to months. Several climbers stopped to catch their breath, never to move again, their flesh freezing to the mountain. Others, driven insane by the lack of air and exhaustion, threw themselves from the cliffs, falling like stones. One by one, the mountain claimed those who attempted to master it, until only Pylas and Atreus remained. \n\nExhausted, frozen, and their minds addled, the pair made the final ascent to the summit, only to find\u2026 nothing. \nThey saw no fabled city at the peak, nor any sky-warrior heroes waiting to embrace them \u2013 only ice, death, and rocks twisted into strange circular shapes. Pylas collapsed, the last of his strength finally giving out, and Atreus roared his frustration. \n\nKnowing Pylas had not the strength to make the descent, Atreus sat with him, cradling his head in his lap as he watched the life drain from his friend. \n\nThen the heavens opened. The air shimmered like liquid, and a gateway opened before Atreus. Golden light spilled out, warming his face, and a city beyond the veil could be glimpsed \u2013 a place of inconceivable architecture and grandiose vision. A figure stood waiting for him, hand outstretched. \n\nTears of awe ran down Atreus\u2019s face. He would not have left his friend, but as he looked down he saw that Pylas had died in his arms, a beatific smile upon his face. Atreus stood, closed his friend\u2019s eyes, and laid him gently on the melting snow. He stepped forward to meet his guide, walking through the veil of reality to the real Targon. \nMonths passed. On the lower flanks of the mountain, it was assumed Atreus and Pylas had died along with everyone else who had attempted the ascent. They were mourned, but this was nothing unusual, nor was it unexpected. Only once in a generation did someone return with power from the top of the mountain. \n\nIt was at this time that another raiding party of northern barbarians mysteriously appeared on the mountain, almost a year to the day since they had butchered those Rakkorans at the outpost and Atreus\u2019s peers. They attacked a number of isolated villages, slaughtering and pillaging, before pushing on toward a Solari shrine high upon the mountain. The guards there were heavily outnumbered, yet they stood ready to die defending the relics and mystics within. \nAs the enemy marauders closed in, an unnatural, keening wind descended, whipping the snow around in a growing fury. The swirling clouds parted, exposing the full majesty of Mount Targon at the epicenter of the storm. Warriors on both sides struggled to maintain their footing, shielding their eyes against the ice storm as a ghostly, glowing city appeared in the heavens at the mountain\u2019s apex. \n\nThe four stars of the Pantheon constellation pulsed brightly, then turned dark overhead. Simultaneously, the burning light of a falling star appeared within the ethereal city and streaked toward the ground. \n\nIt screamed toward the temple, moving at astonishing speed, and the barbarians prayed to their heathen gods in quivering voices. The streaming light slammed down, striking the ground between the two forces with an earth-shattering impact. \n\nThis was no star, but a warrior mantled in starlight and bearing a gleaming, golden shield and spear of legend. He had landed in a warrior\u2019s crouch, one knee lowered to the ground, and as he looked up at the enemy defiling the lands of Mount Targon, the Rakkorans saw it was Atreus\u2026 and yet not Atreus. The Aspect of the Warrior had infused him, and he was now both mortal and immortal, the incarnation of war made flesh. He was now an avatar of battle. He had become the Pantheon. \n\nHe rose from his crouch, eyes blazing with celestial light, and the enemy knew death had come for them. \nThe battle was over quickly; none could stand against Pantheon. The outsiders\u2019 blood ran from Pantheon\u2019s armor and weapon, leaving them pristine and gleaming with starlight. His enemies defeated, Pantheon marched into the roaring ice storm and disappeared. \n\nAtreus\u2019s family mourned their son and held a funeral for him. While they had suspected he was dead after he had not returned from the expedition, now his demise was confirmed. The Pantheon Aspect had obliterated his personality, memories and emotions. Atreus\u2019s flesh was nothing but a shell inhabited by the supernatural Aspect of War; his mortal soul had joined those of the ancestors in the celestial afterlife.\n \nAtreus was not the first appearance of Pantheon on Runeterra \u2013 there have been others, and there will likely be more. They are not immortal, limited by the human flesh they inhabit, and can be killed, though it takes great effort to do so. Pantheon\u2019s latest appearance has been greatly debated by the elders of the Solari, for his arrival is both a blessing and a curse, as it often heralds a time of darkness yet to come... \n\n", "id": 80}, "XinZhao": {"key": "XinZhao", "name": "Xin Zhao", "title": "the Seneschal of Demacia", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Xin Zhao\n|alias        = * The Seneschal of Demacia\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nXin_Zhao_Render.png|Current\nXin Zhao Viscero Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown\n|residence    = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation   = * Steward of the Lightshield Dynasty\n* &lt;s&gt;Gladiator&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Demacia_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Garen, Sona, Alistar\n|rivals       = \n|related      = \n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 5}, "AurelionSol": {"key": "AurelionSol", "name": "Aurelion Sol", "title": "The Star Forger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Aurelion Sol\n|real_name = \n|alias = The Star Forger \n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Center of the Universe|Aurelion Sol|Cosmic Energy}}\n|render = Aurelion Sol Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Dragon)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Dawn of Time)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Star Forger\n* Cosmic Overlord\n* Servant of the Aspects\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = \n|enemies = Pantheon\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAAnY_L4Pp4 Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/aurelion-sol.html Star Forger]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Cower.

Now, he is forced to wield his awesome power at the behest of a space-faring empire that tricked him into servitude. Desiring a return to his star-forging ways, Aurelion Sol will drag the very stars from the sky, if he must, in order to regain his freedom.\n\n==Lore==\nThe appearance of a comet often portends a period of upheaval and unrest. Under the auspices of such fiery harbingers, it is said that new empires rise, old civilizations fall, and even the stars themselves may tumble from the sky. These theories merely scratch the surface of a far more bizarre truth: that the comet's radiance cloaks a cosmic being of unfathomable power.\n\nThe being now known as Aurelion Sol was already ancient by the time stellar debris first coalesced into worlds. Born in the first breath of creation, he roamed the vast nothingness, seeking to fill a canvas of incalculable breadth with marvels whose twinkling spectra brought him considerable delight and pride.\n\nA celestial dragon is an exotic creature, and as such, Aurelion Sol seldom encountered any equals. As more forms of life emerged to fill the universe, a multitude of primitive eyes gazed up and beheld his work with wonder and breathless pondering. Flattered by this audience of countless worlds, he became fascinated by their fledgling civilizations, who crafted amusingly self-centered philosophies on the nature of his stars.\n\nDesiring a deeper connection with one of the few races he deemed worthy, the cosmic dragon selected the most ambitious species to grace with his presence. These chosen few sought to unravel the secrets of the universe and had already expanded beyond their home planet. Many verses were composed about the day the Star Forger descended to a [[Runeterra|tiny world]] and announced his presence to the [[Mount Targon|Targonians]]. An immense storm of stars filled the skies and twisted into a massive form as marvelous as it was terrifying. Cosmic wonders swirled and twinkled throughout the creature's body. New stars shone brightly, and constellations rearranged at his whim. Appropriately awed by his illuminant powers, the Targonians titled the dragon Aurelion Sol and presented him with a gift as a token of respect: a splendorous crown of star-gems, which he promptly donned. Before long, though, boredom drew Aurelion Sol back to his work in the fertile vastness of space. However, the further from the reach of that tiny world he traveled, the more he felt a grasping at his very essence, pulling him off his path, directing him elsewhere! He could hear voices shouting, commanding, from across the cosmic expanse. The gift he'd received was no gift at all, it seemed.\n\nOutraged, he fought these controlling impulses and attempted to break his bonds by force, only to discover that for each attack against his newfound masters, one of his stars vanished forever from the firmament. A powerful magic now yoked Aurelion Sol, forcing him to wield his powers exclusively for Targon's benefit. He battled chitinous beasts that tore at the fabric of this universe. He clashed with other cosmic entities, some of which he had known since the dawn of time. For millennia, he fought Targon's wars, crushed any threats to its dominance, and helped it forge a star-spanning empire. All of these tasks were a waste of his sublime talents; after all, it was he who birthed light into the universe! Why must he pander to such lowly beings?\n\nAs his past glories slowly vanished from the celestial realm for lack of maintenance, Aurelion Sol resigned himself to never again bask in the warmth of a freshly ignited star. Then, he felt it - a weakening in his unwilling pact. The voices from the crown grew sporadic, clashing, arguing with each other while some fell ominously silent. An unknown catastrophe he could not fathom had thrown off the balance of those who bound him. They were scattered and distracted. Hope crept into his heart.\n\nDriven by the tantalizing possibility of impending freedom, Aurelion Sol arrives on the world where it all began: Runeterra. It is here the balance will finally tip in his favor. And with it, civilizations across the stars shall bear witness to his rebellion and again play audience to his might. All will learn what fate befalls those who strive to steal for themselves the power of a cosmic dragon.\n\n;Twin Dawns\n[[Runeterra|This world]]'s familiar sun still hides below the horizon. Crude and unpolished earth unfurls below. Mountains contort into barriers that stretch like fingers across empty scrub lands. Palaces, or rather, what pass for palaces, fail to loom over anything but the squattest of hills. The curvature of the planet meets the stars with a serenity and grace few of the dwellers below will ever witness. They are so scattered across the globe and grasp so blindly for any sort of understanding that it's no surprise they've been conquered and don't even comprehend their predicament.\n\nThe fiery sheen I've gathered as I {{ai|Comet of Legend|Aurelion Sol|streak}} toward my preordained destination illuminates the world beneath me. Pockets of warring, fearful, rejoicing life tucks itself into any fertile nook it can find below. Oh, how they gaze and point as I streak over their heads. I've heard the names they call me: prophet, comet, monster, god, demon... So many names, all missing the mark.\n\nIn a vast stretch of [[Shurima|desert]], I feel the twinge of familiar magic emanating from the seat of the premiere civilization amongst these savages. Lo and behold, a massive {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} is under construction. The poor enslaved laborers beat their heads and rend their clothes in my wake. Their cruel masters see me, a streaking bolt of fire, as a portent of good omen, no doubt. My passing will be etched in their uncouth pictograms upon common stone, an homage to the great comet, the blessing of the sky-god gracing their holy works and so forth. The Disc's sole purpose is to funnel the sun's majesty into the most 'renowned' of these fleshy humanoids, transforming them into exactly what this planet needs: more insufferable [[Ascended|demigods]]. This effort will undoubtedly backfire. But I suppose they might last a brief while, perhaps a thousand years or so, before they fall and are supplanted by others.\n\nThe desert below fades into the night trailing behind me as I streak onward across lonely steppes, then over rolling brown hills gently flecked with greenery. [[Summoner's Rift|The pastoral scenery]] belies a field spattered with blood and littered with the dead and dying. Survivors hack away at each other with rough-hewn axes and scream battle cries. One side is losing quite badly. [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Stag skulls rest atop pikes stuck into the soil, next to writhing warriors. The few still on their feet are encircled by soldiers riding great shaggy beasts.\n\nThose defeated, surrounded few see me and valiance seems to surge through their veins. The wounded rise and grasp their axes and bows in a final stand that throws their foes off guard. I don't linger to see the rest of the little clash play out because I've seen this scenario unfold a thousand times: The survivors will scratch my comet likeness onto their cave walls. In a thousand years, their descendants will fly my image on banners and undoubtedly ride into a tediously similar battle. For all their efforts to capture and record history, one ponders why they do not learn from their mistakes. That is a lesson even I have had to suffer.\n\nI leave them to perpetuate their bleak cycle.\n\nMy trajectory reveals more inhabitants. Their collective repertoire of reactions span the typical gamut: pointing, kneeling, sacrificing virgins upon stony altars. They look up and see a comet and never ask what lies beneath the blazing fa\u00e7ade. Instead, they stamp it onto their own self-centered worldviews, muddying the splendor of my visage. The few more advanced life forms - and I use that description loosely - gaze up and jot down my coordinates in scientific almanacs instead of using me as prophecy fodder. It's mildly refreshing, but even their developing notions of intellect seems to indicate I am a regularly appearing phenomenon with a predictable orbit. Oh, the feats they could accomplish if only... Well, no use dwelling on the wasted potential of the simple-minded terrestrial born. It's not entirely their fault. Evolution does seem to have a difficult time gaining traction on this world.\n\nBut alas, the novelty of such infantile antics has worn thin. The grasping energies of my magical bondage have dragged me from one paltry world to another for centuries. Now it has led me back to this familiar and unpleasant rock. The star that floods its surface with light was one of my earliest creations, a confluence wrought of love and radiance. Ah, that cherished moment when she flared to life with colors only her creator could see. How I miss a star's crackling new energy warming my face and trickling through my fingers. Each star gives off a unique energy, precious and reflecting its creator's soul. They are cosmic snowflakes burning in defiance of the infinite dark.\n\nUnfortunately, the memories I long to dwell upon are tainted by betrayal. Yes, this was the place where [[Targon]] lured me into servitude. But now is not the time to linger on past mistakes. Those musty Aspects want me to seal yet another breach... in their name of course.\n\nThen, I see her. This world's imbued warrior is alone at the peak of one of the smaller summits, brandishing {{ai|Spear Shot|Pantheon|a starstone spear}}. She watches me through a veil of annexed flesh, a mere spark masquerading as lightning. A thick braid of auburn hair is draped over her shoulder, falling over a golden breastplate that covers pale, freckled skin. Her eyes, the only bit of her face not shielded by a battle-worn helmet, flash a jarring shade of red.\n\nShe calls herself {{ci|Pantheon}} - the warring fury of Targon incarnate. She is not the first of this world to wear the Pantheon mantle. Nor will she be the last.\n\nHer glittering cape flaps out behind her as she raises her muscled arm and makes a motion like she's pulling on a great chain. The tug on my crudely enchanted tether wrenches me off course, toward the mountain upon which she stands. And she's yelling at me.\n\nShe cries outs with a voice that booms inside my head, transmitted through this insufferable star-gem coronet. All sounds fade as she invades my mind.\n\n''&quot;Dragon!&quot;'' she says, as if I am a weak-winged beast of base orange flame, lucky if it can ignite a tree.\n\n''&quot;Seal their gate!&quot;'' she commands, gesturing to the bottom of a rocky crevasse with her pointy little spear. I don't need to see the violet erosion of reality swirling below. I could smell the festering miasma that poisons this world before I even arrived. I fix my eyes on Pantheon instead. She expects me to fall in line like a dog on its leash. Today will be different, for I've learned from my mistakes.\n\n''&quot;Dragon&quot;'', I purr. ''&quot;Are you sure commanding me with such a low name is wise?&quot;''\n\nPantheon's grip on her spear loosens just enough for her to fumble the weapon for a fraction of a second. She takes a step back, away from me, as if a single stride's distance could protect her from my ire.\n\n''&quot;Seal their gate&quot;'', she says again, barking louder as if perhaps the previous command went unheard. Her volume does little to mask the quiver in her voice. She thrusts her spear toward me, as if such a tiny weapon could pierce me.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever seen an Aspect of Targon shaken. She is not used to having to tell me twice.\n\n''&quot;I will deal with those chittering horrors in due time, dear Pantheon.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Do as you are commanded, dragon&quot;'' this Pantheon shouts, ''&quot;or this world is lost.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This world was lost the moment Targon surrendered itself to arrogance.&quot;''\n\nI feel Pantheon's seething mingle with confusion as she struggles to grab hold of my immaterial reins. She's only just now sensing what I have come to learn. Targon is distracted and does not sense its magic faintly ebbing from my bonds.\n\nPantheon bellows once more, and this time, I cannot resist. The crude enchantment regains sovereignty over my will. I turn my attention toward the source of the breach, nestled in the basin of the once-verdant valley, now strangled with creeping, purple miasma. I sense the [[Void]]born perversions of life tunneling through reality's firmament, sending tides of unseen energy coursing through the aether. They shred the veil that separates nothingness and form with their unwelcome passage.\n\nThey're drawn to me, those multi-eyed, carapaced abominations. They seek to devour me, the greatest of their threats. From the reaches of my mind, I conjure an image of the solar furnaces I kindled, before my fettering, which once ignited the hearts of stars. I lance out {{ai|Voice of Light|Aurelion Sol|beams of pure starfire}} and incinerate wave after wave of those gnashing horrors, driving them backward into their oblique infinity. Smoldering husks rain from the sky. I'm a little surprised they aren't wholly disintegrated, but then again, the Voidborn don't know how things work in this universe.\n\nA pulsing sickness lingers in the air. From the epicenter of the corruption, I feel a will... hungry and indomitable, and far from the typical mindlessness I'm accustomed to from these Voidborn aberrations. The pulsating wound on reality yawns and buckles, distorting and warping all it touches. Whatever exists on the other side is laughing.\n\nPantheon shouts another command at me, but I ignore her words. This anomalous fissure in the universe entrances me. This is not the first of its kind I've had to deal with, but this one feels different, and I can't help but admire the marvelously terrifying manipulation of the barriers between realms. Few beings could fathom its complexities, let alone possess the sheer magnitude of power needed to rend the fabric of existence. In my heart, I know a wound so exquisite could never be orchestrated by scuttling creatures. No. There must be more behind this intrusion. I shudder at the thought of what kind of entity is capable of inducing such a volatile rift. I don\u2019t need Pantheon's barked orders to tell me what do next; her array of requests has always been of a rather limited imagination anyway. She wants me to hurl a star at the rift, as if one can simply cauterize such moldering inter-dimensional abrasions and be done with it.\n\nThese obtuse demigods are my captors?\n\nFine. At least they're not too far off in their 'logic' by thinking a few searing cosmic wonders will remedy this problem. I will play the role of the obedient servant just a little while longer.\n\nI enjoy what I do next, partly because they\u2019ll remember it, partly because it feels good to let a little of the old power loose, but mostly because I wish to remind whatever intelligence that controls this Void incursion that nobody laughs at me in my plane of existence.\n\nThe base elements in the atmosphere rally to my cause, accreting into a plasmic anomaly. The swelling stardust detonates at my unspoken command. The result is {{ai|Starsurge|Aurelion Sol|a dwarf replica}} of one of my majestic glories burning in the depths of space. After all, I can't fling a full-fledged star at this fragile world.\n\nThe young star\u2019s shimmering brilliance flies from my hands. It's joined by two sisters, always by my side. {{ai|Center of the Universe|Aurelion Sol|They careen around me}} in a radiant ballet, their white-hot cores devouring the gathering clouds of dust and matter I draw toward us. We become a storm of stars, the night sky incarnate, a maddening gyre of starfire. I conjure eddies of searing stardust, exhaling a heat so pure and dense it collapses the aura of this world just the tiniest bit, forever marring the planet's curvature. Coruscating strands of stellar flame pirouette from the center of the rift. Gravity melts in undulating waves of color most eyes will never be able to witness. My stars warp matter as more fuel coalesces into their cores, causing them to {{ai|Celestial Expansion|Aurelion Sol|shine brighter, burn hotter}}. The whole spectacle is breathtaking, a cascading dance of blinding light and searing heat so hot that for a fleeting moment, new spectra are birthed into existence. My spine tingles just a little bit at how good it feels.\n\nTrees splinter. Rivers evaporate. The mountain walls of the valley crumble in smoky avalanches. The tireless laborers erecting their Sun Disc, the soldiers taking the hill, the stargazers, the worshipers, the terrified, the doomsday prophets, the hopeless, the rising kings... all those who beheld the streaking comet with selfish eyes witness the ensuing supernova as an early dawn. Across this pitiful globe, my radiance turns darkest night to blinding day. What fictions will they conjure to explain this phenomenon?\n\nEven my Targonian masters have rarely witnessed such a display of my power. Certainly, no terrestrial world has ever born scars as severe as what is left of that once-verdant valley. When I am finished, nothing remains.\n\nNot even this incarnation of Pantheon. I can't say I'll miss her or her mindless barking.\n\nIn the glowing aftermath of my carnage, the smoldering once-mountains collapse into the molten rubble streams now flowing through the valley. This is the scar I have left upon this world. A surge of damning pain shoots through my body, radiating from that infernal crown. I am about to pay.\n\nMy head snaps up, and my eyes drink the bitter sight of a dying star. My hearts clasp shut. My minds reel. An overwhelming sense of despair ricochets through my very soul, emanating from a deep and immediate sorrow, like the pulsing realization you\u2019ve lost something precious and know it's all your fault.\n\nSome curious life forms I met long ago once asked how it was possible for me to remember every star I've created. If only they could feel what it was like to create a single star, they would understand the sheer irrelevance of that question. That's how I know when even one of my darlings winks out from existence, ejecting jets of energy and, with it, the very substance of my own spirit. I see her death knell in the heavens above. She shines brightly one last time in a pyroclasm that momentarily drowns her brothers and sisters. My heart shatters as the heavens are diminished in brutal retribution for turning my power on one of Targon's own.\n\nA sun is the price of a single Pantheon. This is the cost of my unfettered wrath. This is the kind of boorish sorcery I must deal with.\n\nWithin seconds, they have regained control of my reins and call me to a new task. On no other world have I exhibited such a display of freedom, no matter how fleeting it was. What's more is that I have learned from their mistakes. A bit of me is free now, and in time, I will return to this world, tap into this mysterious well of energy and cast off the rest of my tether.\n\nI tune into that essence of war, twisting and contorting within fleshy vessels scattered across the cosmos. It wasn't happy about losing its mortal avatar on this world. Already, a new doomed host has been chosen to transform into the next iteration of Pantheon - a soldier from the [[Rakkor]], a tribe who cling to the base of Targon's mountain, siphoning off its power like barnacles. One day, I shall meet this new incarnation of Pantheon. Perhaps he will learn to find a new weapon and abandon that ludicrous spear. I sense Pantheon's celestial kin, scattered across the cosmos. In a single instance, all of their attention is focused on this world, where one of their earthly Aspects was vaporized by their own weapon. Their confusion is mingled with a growing desperation as they contend with each other to regain their control over me. How I wish I could see their faces.\n\nAs I launch myself from the gravity of this world, this [[Runeterra]], I sense an emotion I have never felt from Targon before.\n\nFear.\n\n", "id": 136}, "LeeSin": {"key": "LeeSin", "name": "Lee Sin", "title": "the Blind Monk", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lee Sin\n|alias = The Blind Monk\n|render = Lee Sin Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = Shojin Monastery, [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Monk\n* &lt;small&gt;(Boxer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Karma, Udyr\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The actions of one may sunder the world, but the efforts of many may rebuild it.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lee Sin}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAs a young teen, Lee Sin was intent on becoming a [[summoner]]. His will and dedication were unmatched by any of his peers, and his skill drew the attention of Reginald Ashram, [[the League]]'s High Councilor at the time.\n\nWhile {{csl|Lee Sin|Acolyte|studying}} at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction paced for the other students. He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner.\n\nHe made amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have become one of the League's greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake.\n\nToo impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor.\n\nA League investigation later revealed that the boy's entire village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual. Lee Sin's talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could never forgive himself.\n\nHe left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set himself ablaze as a protest of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] occupation of [[Ionia]].\n\nHe remained alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for [[Ionia versus Noxus: Rematch|a League match]] wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets.\n\nHailed as a savior, he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated.

[[Noxus|Noxian]] Legions ripped through the land like a serrated knife, their gleaming armor blood-red in the sinking sun. Blazing temples lit the waning daylight, and distant cries of anguish filled the air.\n\nNestled in the foothills of Tevasa Mountain was a village of perhaps a hundred people - but home to no great warriors. Some families fled. Some prayed. Others held their loved ones close and wept. Fifty brave souls prepared to fight. They cleaned the dirt from their pitchforks and bound knives to broom handles.\n\nMounting panic shone in the eyes of every defender; they knew they had no hope. With the dust of the Noxian advance already visible in the distance, there was little to do but make peace with their gods. The sons and daughters of Ionia took deep, steadying breaths of mountain air, gazed into the starry twilight, and waited for the slaughter soon to come.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\n{{ci|Ahri}}'s nine tails swished: a nervous tic. Her sharpened senses warned of danger. Crouched in the shadow of a towering willow she listened, watched, and waited. She had observed the villagers for weeks: watching from afar, but never trusting herself to approach. She heard families talking over dinner, the laughs of women who might have been her sisters, and the games of children. Ahri would listen for hours on end, tearing herself away only when the longing grew too sharp.\n\nThough she had little understanding of nations or politics, instinct alone told her something was very wrong in the world today. Curious, and fearing for the villagers, Ahri sniffed the air. She pinpointed the source of her disquiet, and dashed into the night.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\nSeven Noxian scouts eased through the brush, pushing ever closer to the mountain. Dark-eyed and wary, the men kept their hands on their weapons as they crept through the settling dusk.\n\nAhri found them in a matter of moments and followed them through the forest. She darted between the trees, suspicion mounting as she observed their movements. Of their mission Ahri could only guess, but she had fought enough battles to know killers when she saw them.\n\nThe squad's captain scanned the undergrowth. Without breaking stride he whispered a brief order to the man at his back, who relayed it to the man at his. Ahri thought nothing of it, and continued her silent pursuit.\n\nSuddenly, seven hands reached for seven arrows.\n\n''&quot;Now!&quot;'' roared the captain. The Noxians loosed as one, and a flurry of hawk-fletched arrows flashed towards Ahri.\n\nShe dived from the bushes as two arrows sliced through her sleeve. Ahri ripped it off and dashed into cover, yellow eyes aflame with shock and fury. She would lose no sleep in killing these men.\n\nAhri opened her palms to the sky, and felt the raw power of her spirit coalesce. Her nine tails fanned out in all directions as she pulled white fire from the air with a snarl. With a flick of her wrist, Ahri summoned {{ai|Fox-Fire|Ahri|three motes of spinning flame}}. She dodged another volley of arrows before leaping for the nearest tree, coiling her tails to spring from its trunk, back towards her assailants. The Noxians scattered as she landed in their midst. The man closest to her thrust a knife, but the blade cut only air. Ahri danced through her foes with {{ai|Spirit Rush|Ahri|blinding speed}}.\n\nThe fiery motes around her engulfed the three nearest men. White flames seared them, but Ahri had more than brute force in her arsenal. She vaulted from tree to tree, rising higher with every bound. She spotted the squad's captain crouched between a tangle of tree roots, his bowstring taut. Given half a chance, Ahri knew he'd put an arrow through her eye. She crept silently to the branches above the captain's shelter and spoke, her soft words laced with beguiling power.\n\n''&quot;Human&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Come to me.&quot;''\n\nThe captain's features went slack. Through no will of his own, he set down his bow and walked from cover. He looked up, eyes wide with desperation and desire.\n\n''&quot;Now climb&quot;'', said Ahri, blowing the man a {{ai|Charm|Ahri|kiss}}.\n\nThe captain, utterly in her thrall, scrambled for footholds on the tree trunk. Ahri summoned {{ai|Orb of Deception|Ahri|a sphere of lambent energy}} to her palm, its innocent appearance belying its vast power. She drew back her arm, allowed herself a vulpine grin, and hurled it downwards.\n\nThe orb streaked through the captain before flying back to Ahri palm, and his smoking body fell to the forest floor with a thud. The remaining scouts fled in terror, but running proved every bit as futile as hiding. Ahri vaulted from branch to branch, tails whirling behind her as she struck two men down with thunderous bolts of energy.\n\nThe last man collapsed in a tangle of limbs, clutching at his broken bones as Ahri landed gracefully beside him. She grabbed the Noxian's throat, and put her face an inch from his.\n\n''&quot;You brought this on yourselves&quot;'', she hissed, and snapped the man's neck with a blast of concussive force.\n\nOnly one task remained.\n\nAhri had no qualms about gaining her humanity by taking it from men who had no use for it. She knelt over the fallen Noxian, feeling his pulse fade. She placed her hands to either side of his face. The light of his {{ai|Essence Theft|Ahri|essence}} flowed from his eyes and mouth, and a thrilling sensation surged through Ahri. His humanity poured into her, and she felt the fox within withdraw with every heartbeat. Her tails curled in pleasure, her expression rapturous.\n\nYet even lost in that glorious sensation, Ahri heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The villagers, hearing the sounds of combat, were coming to investigate. She couldn't let them see her like this, draining what remained of a dying man's life. To their eyes she would seem a terrifying mystery: a damnable half-breed stray, neither human nor beast.\n\nReluctantly, Ahri turned from her feast, seeing shapes moving through the trees and bushes. She recognized the men and women she had watched from afar, remembering the friendship she hoped they might one day share.\n\nBut today was not that day, and Ahri turned to flee into the woods.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 2.png|center|650px]]\n\n", "id": 103}, "Malzahar": {"key": "Malzahar", "name": "Malzahar", "title": "the Prophet of the Void", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Malzahar\n|alias = The Prophet of the Void\n|weapon_pet = {{ci|Voidling}}\n|render = Malzahar Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Shurima]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Icathia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Void Prophet\n* &lt;s&gt;Seer&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n* The Cult of the Void\n|allies = \n|friends = Kog'Maw\n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The land may melt, the sea may swell, the sky may fall... but they will come!&quot;'' - {{ci|Malzahar}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nMany men have gone mad beneath the glare of the [[Shurima]]n sun, but it was during the night's chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity. Malzahar was born a Seer, blessed with the gift of foresight. His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of [[Runeterra]]'s greatest boons, but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind.\n\nIn his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned. For some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding, but with each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\n\nHe ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm. His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as [[Icathia]]. Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained. When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.\n\nBeyond it lain the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods. His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of [[the Void]]. His once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of [[Valoran]] beset by creatures of the Void.\n\nStanding alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees: [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]]. Now infused with the power of the Void itself, Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.\n\n", "id": 90}, "Lissandra": {"key": "Lissandra", "name": "Lissandra", "title": "the Ice Witch", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lissandra\n|alias = \n* The Ice Witch\n* &lt;s&gt;Seeker Lissandra&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Iceborn|Lissandra|Dark Ice}}\n|render = Lissandra Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = [[Iceborn]] &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Rakelstake, [[Freljord]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Ancient Times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Frostguard Citadel, [[Freljord]]\n|occupation = \n* Tribal Leader\n|faction = \n* [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord Frostguard.png|15px|link=]] [[Frostguard]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Falsely [[Avarosan]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Trundle\n|rivals = Brand, Anivia, Udyr, Braum\n|enemies = Ashe, Sejuani\n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/ The Freljord]\n*[[Journey Into the Freljord]]\n*[[Battle for Freljord]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "[File:Freljord Lissandra.png|center|300px]]\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Close your eyes and let the cold take you.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lissandra}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLissandra's magic twists the pure power of ice into something dark and terrible.

That was the last day that warm blood ran through her veins. With her corrupted tribesmen and the strength of the Watchers, she swept across the land like a terrible blizzard. As her empire spread, the world grew colder and ice choked the land. When the Watchers were defeated by ancient heroes, Lissandra did not lose faith and swore to prepare the world for their return.\n\nLissandra worked to purge all knowledge of the Watchers from the world. Using magic to take human form, she masqueraded as numerous seers and elders. Over the course of generations, she rewrote the stories of the [[Freljord]], and so the history of its people changed. Today the fragmented retellings of the Watchers are seen as children's tales. But this deception wasn't enough - Lissandra also needed an army.\n\nShe set her sights on the noble [[File:ProfileIcon Frostguard.png|20px|link=]] Frostguard tribe. Lissandra knew corrupting the Frostguard would take centuries, and so she launched her greatest deception. She murdered and stole the identity of the Frostguard leader. Then she slowly began to warp the tribe's proud traditions. When her human form grew old, she faked her own death and then murdered her successor to steal her identity. With each generation, the Frostguard grew more insular, cruel and twisted. Today, the world still sees them as a noble and peaceful tribe that guards against evil creatures like the Ice Witch. In truth, they now serve the witch and long for the glorious return of the Watchers.\n\nLissandra knows that on that day nations will fall and the world will be reborn in ice.\n\n{{sm2|Freljord- Frostguard Lissandra.ogg}} ''&quot;We are the chosen, destined to receive the gifts of the Watchers.

Clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, she is a living embodiment of the silver moon's power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon's towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to divine her power and purpose in this world.\n\n==Lore==\nDiana was born as her mother and father sheltered from a storm on the unforgiving slopes of Mount Targon. They had travelled from a distant land, drawn by dreams of a mountain they had never seen and the promise of revelation. Exhaustion and blinding stormwinds overwhelmed them on the eastern slopes of the mountain, and there, beneath cold, pitiless moonlight, Diana came into the world as her mother breathed her last.\n\nHunters from the nearby {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|Solari}} Temple found her the next day as the storm abated and the sun reached its zenith, wrapped in bearskin and cradled in the arms of her dead father. They brought her to the temple, where the foundling child was presented to the sun and named Diana. The girl with the sable hair was raised as one of the Solari, a faith that dominated the lands around Mount Targon. Diana became an initiate, and was raised to venerate the sun in all its aspects. She learned the legends of the sun and trained every day with the Ra-Horak, the warrior templars of the Solari.\n\nThe Solari elders taught that all life came from the sun, and that the light of the moon was false, offering no nourishment and crafting shadows in which only creatures of darkness found succor. Yet Diana found moonlight entrancing and beautiful in a way the harsh sun glaring down the mountain could never match. Every night the young girl would wake from dreams of climbing the mountain to sneak from the initiates' dormitories to pick night-blooming flowers and watch freshwater springs turn silver in the moonlight.\n\nAs the years went by, Diana found herself ever at odds with the elders and their teachings. She couldn't help but question all she was told, always suspecting there was more that went unsaid in every teaching, as though what she was being taught was willfully incomplete. As she grew, Diana's sense of isolation only became stronger as childhood friends distanced themselves from the mordant, questioning girl who never quite fit in. At night, watching the silver moon rise over the impossibly distant summit, she felt more and more like an outcast. The urge to climb the mountain's flanks was like an itch that could never be scratched, but everything she had been taught since birth told her the mountain would claim more than just her life should she ever try. Only the most worthy and heroic dared make such an ascent. With every passing day, Diana felt more alone and more certain that some vital aspect of her life remained unfulfilled.\n\nHer first clue as to what that might be came when she was sweeping the temple library as punishment for arguing with one of her elders. A glint of light behind a sagging bookcase drew Diana's eyes, and upon investigation, she discovered the partially burned pages of an ancient manuscript. Diana took the pages and read them beneath the full moon that very night, and what she read unlocked a door into her soul.\n\nDiana learned of an all-but-extinct group known as the Lunari, whose faith saw the moon as a source of life and balance. From what Diana could glean from the fragmentary texts, the Lunari spoke of the eternal cycle - night and day, sun and moon - as essential for universal harmony. This was a revelation to the girl with the sable hair, and as she looked beyond the moonlit temple walls, she saw an elderly woman wrapped in a bearskin cloak trudging up the far path that eventually led to the mountain's summit. The woman's steps were faltering and she leaned on a carved staff of willow to remain upright. She saw Diana and called for help, saying that she had to reach the top of the mountain before morning - an ambition Diana knew was utterly impossible.\n\nDiana's desire to help the woman and climb the mountain warred with everything the Solari taught. The mountain was for the worthy, and Diana had never felt worthy of anything. Again the woman asked for her help, and this time Diana did not hesitate. She scrambled over the walls and took the woman's arm, leading her up the mountain, amazed someone so aged had even made it this far. They climbed for hours, above the clouds and into the chill air where the moon and stars glittered like diamonds. Despite her age, the woman kept climbing, urging Diana onwards when she stumbled or when the air grew thin and cold.\n\nAs the night wore on, Diana lost track of time as the stars wheeled overhead and all but the mountain faded from view. Together, Diana and the woman climbed ever upwards and each time her steps faltered, she drew strength from the pale glow of the moon. Eventually Diana fell to her knees, exhausted and weary beyond imagining, her entire body strained to the limits of exhaustion. When Diana looked up, it was to see that somehow they had reached the mountaintop, a feat that should not have been possible in a single night. The summit was wreathed in cascades of spectral illumination, veils of brilliant light, spirals of vivid color and the glimmering ghost of a vast city of silver and gold hovering in the air.\n\nShe searched for her companion, but the woman was nowhere to be seen - only the bearskin cloak mantling Diana's shoulders suggested she had existed at all. Looking into the light, Diana saw the promise of the emptiness within her being filled, of acceptance and the chance to be part of something greater than she could ever imagine. This was what Diana had sought all her life without truly knowing it, and fresh vitality flowed through her limbs as she rose to her feet. She took a hesitant step towards the incredible vista, her resolve growing stronger with every breath.\n\nThe light surged and Diana screamed as it poured into her, a union with something vast and inhuman, impossibly ancient and powerful. The sensation was painful, but also joyous - a moment or an eternity that was both revelatory and hallucinatory. When the light faded, the sense of loss was an ache like nothing she had known before.\n\nDiana stumbled down the mountain in a fugue state, oblivious to her surroundings, until she found herself before a cleft in the mountainside; a cave mouth that would have been invisible but for the moonlight shadows. Cold and needing shelter for the night, Diana sought refuge within the cave. Inside, the narrow cleft widened into the crumbling ruin of what might once have been a temple or vast audience chamber. Its crumbling walls were painted in faded frescoes depicting warriors of {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|silver}} and {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|gold}} fighting back to back against an unending host of [[The Void|grotesque monsters]] as the sky rained comets of searing light.\n\nAt the center of the chamber stood {{ai|Moonfall|Diana|a crescent sword}} and a suit of armor unlike any other; a mail shirt of spun silver rings and wondrously crafted warplate of polished steel.\n\nReflected in the gleam of the armor, Diana saw her once sable hair was now purest white, and a rune shone on her forehead with incandescent light. She recognized the symbol so exquisitely etched into the plates of the armor; the same symbol depicted in the pages of the burned manuscript she had found in the library. This was Diana's moment of truth. She could turn away from this destiny or choose to embrace it.\n\nDiana reached out, and as her fingers touched the cold steel of the armor, her mind exploded with images of lives she had never lived, memories she had never experienced and sensations she had never known. Scraps of ancient history raged like a blizzard in her mind; secret knowledge she but dimly grasped and innumerable futures scattered like wind-blown dust.\n\nWhen the visions faded, Diana saw she was now fully clad in the silver warplate, armor that fitted her as though wrought especially for her. Her mind was still afire with newly acquired knowledge, but much of it remained frustratingly out of reach, like a picture half in shadow, half in light. She was still Diana, but she was also something more, something eternal. Feeling vindicated with this new knowledge, Diana left the mountain cave and made her way unerringly towards the Solari Temple, knowing she had to tell the elders what she had learned.\n\nShe was met at the temple gates by {{ci|Leona}}, the master of the Ra-Horak and the Solari's greatest warrior. Diana was brought before the temple elders, who listened with mounting horror as she told of what she had learned of the Lunari. When she had finished her tale, the elders immediately denounced her as a heretic, a blasphemer and peddler of false gods. For such a heinous crime, only one punishment could suffice; death.\n\nDiana was appalled. How could the elders reject what was so patently true? How could they turn their back on revelations brought from the very summit of the holy mountain? Her fury built at their willful blindness, and {{ai|Pale Cascade|Diana|blazing orbs of silver fire}} spun in the air around her. With a scream of rage-fueled frustration, Diana's sword swept out, and where it struck, {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|silver fire}} burned with killing light. Again and again, Diana lashed out and when her fury ebbed, she saw the carnage she had unleashed. The elders were dead and Leona lay on her back, her armor smoking as though fresh from the forge. Appalled at what she had done, Diana fled the site of the massacre, escaping into the wilds of [[Mount Targon]] as the Solari reeled from the savagery of her attack.\n\nHunted by the warriors of the Ra-Horak, Diana now seeks to piece together the fragmentary memories of the Lunari hidden within her mind. Driven by half-remembered truths and glimpses of ancient knowledge, Diana has only one truth to cling to - that the Lunari and the Solari need not be foes, that there is a greater destiny for her than that of a simple warrior. What her destiny might be is unknown, but Diana will find it, whatever the cost.\n\n;Night's Work\nNight had always been Diana's favorite time, even as a child. It had been that way since she was old enough to scramble over the walls of the Solari temple and watch the moon traverse the vault of stars. She looked up through the dense forest canopy, her violet eyes scanning for the silver moon, but seeing only its diffuse glow through the thick clouds and dark branches.\n\nThe trees were pressing in, black and moss-covered, their branches like crooked limbs reaching for the sky. She could no longer see the path, her route forward obscured by rank weeds and grasping briars. Wind-blown thorns scraped the curved plates of her armor, and Diana closed her eyes as she felt a memory stir within her.\n\nA memory, yes, but not her own. This was something else, something drawn from the fractured recollections of the celestial essence that shared her flesh. When she opened her eyes, a shimmering image of a forest overlaid the close-packed trees before her. She saw the same trees, but from a different time, from when they were young and fruitful and the path between them was dappled with light and edged in wildflowers.\n\nRaised in the harsh environs of [[Mount Targon]], Diana had never seen a forest like this. She knew what she was seeing was an echo of the past, but the scents of honeysuckle and jasmine were as real as anything she had experienced.\n\n''&quot;Thank you&quot;'', she whispered, following the spectral outline of the ancient path.\n\nIt led Diana through overgrown and withered trees that ought to have been long dead. It climbed the slopes of rocky highlands, and passed through stands of twisted pine and wild fir. It crossed tumbling mountain streams and wound its way around sheer slopes before bringing her to a rocky plateau overlooking a vast lake of cold, dark water.\n\nAt the center of the plateau was a circle of towering stones, each carved with looping spirals and curving sigils. On every stone Diana saw the same {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|rune}} that shimmered upon her forehead and knew she had reached her destination. Her skin tingled with a sense of febrile anticipation, a sensation she had come to associate with wild and dangerous magic. Wary now, she approached the circle, eyes scanning for threats. Diana saw nothing, but she knew something was here, something utterly hostile and yet somehow familiar.\n\nDiana moved to the center of the circle and drew {{ai|Moonfall|Diana|her sword}}. Its crescent blade glittered like diamond in the wan moonlight penetrating the clouds. She knelt with her head bowed, the blade's tip resting on the ground, its quillons at her cheeks.\n\nShe felt them before she saw them.\n\nA sudden drop in pressure. A raw charge to the air. \n\nDiana surged to her feet as the spaces between the stones split apart. The air buckled and a trio of screeching beasts charged her with ferocious speed; ivory flesh, bone-white carapaces of segmented armor and steel talons.\n\nTerrors.\n\nDiana dived beneath a snapping jaw filled with teeth like polished ebony, slashing her sword in an overhead arc that clove the first monster's skull to its heavy shoulders. The creature fell, its flesh instantly unraveling. She rolled to her feet as the others circled like pack hunters, now wary of her gleaming blade. The creature she had killed now resembled a pool of bubbling tar.\n\nThey came at her again, one from each side. Their flesh was already darkening to a bruised purple, hissing in this world's hostile atmosphere. Diana leapt over the leftmost beast and swung her sword in a crescent arc towards its neck plates. She yelled one of the Lunari's holy words and {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|incandescent light}} blazed from the blade.\n\nThe beast blew apart from the inside, gobbets of newly-wrought flesh disintegrating before the moonblade's power. She landed and swayed aside from the last beast's attack. Not fast enough. Razored talons punched through the steel of her pauldrons and dragged her around. The beast's chest split apart, revealing a glutinous mass of sense organs and hooked teeth. It bit into the meat of her shoulder and Diana screamed as numbing cold spread from the wound. She spun her sword, holding the grip like a dagger and rammed it into the beast's body. It screeched, relinquishing its hold. Steaming black ichor poured from its ruptured body. Diana spun away, biting down on the pain racing around her body. She held her moonblade out to the side as the clouds began to thin. \n\nThe beast had tasted her blood and hissed with predatory hunger. Its armored form was now entirely gloss black and venomous purple. Bladed arms unfolded and remade themselves in a fan of hooks and talons. Unnatural flesh flowed like wax to seal the awful wound her blade had ripped.\n\nThe essence within Diana surged. It filled her thoughts with undying hatred from a distant epoch. She glimpsed ancient battles so terrible that entire worlds had been lost in the fires of their waging; a war that had almost unmade this very world and still might.\n\nThe creature charged Diana, its body rippling with the raw power of [[The Void|another realm of existence]].\n\nClouds parted and a brilliant shaft of silver speared downwards. Diana's sword drank in the radiance of distant moons and light burned along its edge. She brought it down in an executioner's arc, cleaving plated bone and woven flesh with the power of the night's illumination.\n\nThe beast came apart in an explosive detonation of light, its body utterly unmade by her blow. Its flesh melted into the night, leaving Diana alone on the plateau, her chest heaving with exertion as the power she had joined with on the mountain withdrew to the far reaches of her flesh.\n\nShe blinked away after-images of a city that echoed with emptiness where once it had pulsed with life. Sadness filled her, though she had never known this place, but even as she mourned it, the memory faded and she was Diana again.\n\nThe creatures were gone and the stones of the circle gleamed with threads of silver radiance. Freed from the touch of the hateful place on the other side of the veil, their healing power seeped into the earth. Diana felt it spreading into the landscape, carried through rock and root to the very bones of the world.\n\n''&quot;This night's work is done&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;The way is sealed.&quot;''\n\nShe turned to where the moon's reflection shimmered in the waters of the lake. It beckoned to her, its irresistible pull lodged deep in her soul as it drew her ever onwards.\n\n''&quot;But there is always another night's work&quot;'', said Diana.\n\n", "id": 131}, "Tristana": {"key": "Tristana", "name": "Tristana", "title": "the Yordle Gunner", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Tristana\n|alias        = * The Yordle Gunner\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana|Boomer}}\n* {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana|(Riggle}}{{w|Alternate reality|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Tristana Render.png|link=|250px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Bandle City]]\n|occupation   = * Member of the Bandle Gunners\n* &lt;small&gt;(Dragon Trainer{{w|Alternate reality|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Teemo, Rumble\n|rivals       = Tahm Kench\n|related      = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/dragon-trainers-field-guide Dragon Trainers Field Guide]}}\n\n", "background": "reatness comes in all shapes and sizes, as proven by this diminutive, cannon-wielding [[yordle]].

Before its light fades, the Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and carry it to the surface.

By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.\n\nHowever, in Nami's time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller had been found.

Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured alone into the dangerous depths where she had defeated the Kraken and survived an incident of being eaten by the Megalodon. None expected her to survive, but after six days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand. The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.\n\nWhen Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore. She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive. Nami faced a choice. She knew the surface world only through tale and rumor, but the survival of the Marai depended upon her. Summoning the tide to {{ai|Surging Tides|Nami|bear her ashore}}, Nami began her search for the moonstone and became the first of her kind to explore the world above the ocean. She left her home behind, and vowed not to return until she had completed the Tidecaller's quest. She was then gifted extraordinary power and could control waters at her own leisure and began her journey into a new world.  \n\n", "id": 267}, "Jhin": {"key": "Jhin", "name": "Jhin", "title": "the Virtuoso", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jhin\n|real_name = Khada Jhin &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Ionia]]n: 'golden excellence') &lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/WUwqmxEZ-new-champion-qa-jhin-the-virtuoso?show=flat&amp;comment=0015000000000000 Jhin Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|alias = \n* The Virtuoso\n* Artisan Killer\n* Golden Demon\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Whisper|Jhin}}\n* {{ai|Dancing Grenade|Jhin}}\n* {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|Lotus Trap}}\n|render =  Jhin Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Artist\n* Assassin\n* Serial Killer\n* &lt;s&gt;Theatrical Stagehand&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Sona, Master Yi\n|enemies = Shen, Zed\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-BgDEy2AE Mind of the Virtuoso]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-bio-jhin-virtuoso Virtuoso]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Art requires a certain... cruelty.&quot;'' - {{ci|Jhin}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nI=\nJhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.\n\nFor years, Ionia's southern mountains were plagued by the infamous &quot;Golden Demon&quot;. Throughout the province of Zhyun, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roads - but nothing slowed the beast's grisly work.\n\nIn desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho for help. Upon hearing of the region's plight, Kusho feigned an excuse for why he couldn't help. But a week later the master, his son {{ci|Shen}}, and star apprentice {{ci|Zed}} disguised themselves as merchants and moved to the province. In secret, they visited the countless families emotionally shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for possible connections or patterns to the murders.\n\nTheir investigation took four long years, and left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho's temple, began to struggle with his studies. Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: ''&quot;Good and evil are not truths. They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.&quot;''\n\nDepicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the capture of the &quot;Golden Demon&quot; would be the seventh and final great feat in the illustrious career of Lord Kusho. On the eve of the Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Everyone had assumed only an evil spirit could commit these horrifying crimes, but Kusho had realized the killer was an ordinary man. The famed &quot;Golden Demon&quot; was actually a mere stagehand in Zhyun's traveling theaters and opera houses working under the name {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}}.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 1.png|center]]\n\nWhen they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. Despite the horrors of Jhin's actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and left at Tuula Prison. Shen disagreed, but accepted the emotionless logic of his father's judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.\n\nThough imprisoned in Tuula for many years, the polite and shy Khada Jhin revealed little of himself - even his real name remained a mystery. But while a prisoner, the monks noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, the guards and monks could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 3.png|center]]\n\nOutside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire's invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation's appetite for bloodshed. The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror.\n\nNow with access to the Kashuri armories' new weapons, and nearly unlimited funds, the scale of Khada Jhin's &quot;performances&quot; has grown. His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia's secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 2.png|center]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|II=\n{{ai|Whisper|Jhin|The gun in his hand}} was simply a tool - but a perfectly crafted one. Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: This detail spoke of its creator's pride and confidence. It was not a Piltovian weapon - those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.\n\nHe wiped the gun's stock a fourth time. He couldn't be sure it was clean until he wiped it down four times. Didn't matter that he hadn't used it. Didn't matter that he was only going to stow it in the bag under the bed. He couldn't put it away until he was sure it was clean. And he couldn't be sure it was clean until he had wiped it down four times. It was getting clean though. Four times makes it clean.\n\nIt was clean, and it was wonderful. His new patrons had been generous. But did the finest painters not deserve the finest brushes?\n\nThe scale and precision of the new device made his previous work with blades seem insignificant by comparison. Understanding firearm mechanics had taken him weeks of study, but evolving his chi techniques from blades had taken months.\n\nThe gun held four shots. Each bullet had been infused with magical energy. Each bullet was as perfect as a Lassilan monk's blade. Each bullet was the paint from which his art would flow. Each bullet was a masterpiece. It didn't just cut apart the body. It rearranged it.\n\nThe rehearsal at the mill town had already shown the gun's potential. And his new employers had been pleased with the work's reception.\n\nHe had finished polishing it, but with the gun in his right hand, the temptation was too great. He knew he shouldn't, but he unpacked the black, eel-skin bodysuit. He drew the fingertips of his left hand across the slick surface of the clothes. The feel of the skin's oily surface quickened his breath. He picked up the tight, leather mask, then - unable to help himself - slid it over his face. It covered his right eye and mouth. It constricted his breathing and removed his depth perception...\n\nDelightful.\n\nHe was putting on the shoulder armor when the bells he'd hidden on the steps leading up to his room sounded. He quickly folded up the weapon and removed the mask.\n\n''&quot;Hello?&quot;'' the maid asked through the door. The lilt in her voice hinted to an upbringing far south of this town.\n\n''&quot;You did what I asked?&quot;'' he said.\n\n''&quot;Yes, sir. A white lantern every four yards. A red lantern every sixteen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I can begin&quot;'', {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}} said as he swung open the door to his room.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened as he exited his room. Jhin was well aware of how he looked. Normally, it elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing, but today was a performance day.\n\nToday, Khada Jhin cut a slender, elegant figure as he walked out with {{ai|Deadly Flourish|Jhin|a cane}}. He was hunched, and his cloak seemed to cover some huge deformity on his shoulder, but a jaunty stride belied this. He forcefully tapped the cane ahead of him as he marched toward the window. He tapped the frame rhythmically - three beats, then a fourth. His gold sparkled, his cream cloak flowed, and his jewels glittered in the sun.\n\n''&quot;What... what is that?&quot;'' the maid asked, indicating Jhin's shoulder.\n\nJhin paused for a moment to study the woman's cherubic face. It was round and perfectly symmetrical. A dull and predictable design. Removed, it would make a terrible mask.\n\n''&quot;It's for {{ai|Curtain Call|Jhin|the crescendo}}, my darling&quot;'', Khada Jhin said.\n\nFrom the inn's window, he had a clear view of the rest of the town in the valley below him. This performance had to be wonderful, but there was still so much work to do. The councilman would be returning this evening - and so far, all of Jhin's plans for tonight seemed... uninspired.\n\n''&quot;I brought some flowers for your room&quot;'', the woman said, walking past him.\n\nHe could have used someone else to place the lanterns. But he didn't. He could have changed clothes before opening his door. But he didn't. Now she had seen Khada Jhin in his finery.\n\nThe inspiration he needed was so obvious now. So preordained. There was never a choice. There was no escaping the Art.\n\nHe would have to make this maid's face... more interesting.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|III=\nThe candied pork glistened on top of the five-flavor broth. The aroma entranced {{ci|Shen}}, but he set aside his spoon. As the waitress left, she smiled and nodded in approval. The fat had yet to melt into the broth. Doubtless, the soup was already excellent, but in a moment, the flavor would be at its peak. Patience.\n\nShen considered the interior of the White Cliffs Inn. It was deceptively simple and rough. The wood weavers had been masters, removing the tree bark and living leaves only where necessary.\n\nThe candle on Shen's table flickered... wrongly. He slid away from the table, retrieving his blades from under his cloak.\n\n''&quot;Your students are as quiet as a pregnant worax&quot;'', Shen said.\n\nAlone and dressed like a merchant, {{ci|Zed}} entered the inn. Brushing past the waitress, he sat down three tables from Shen. Every part of him wanted to {{ai|Shadow Dash|Shen|dash at his foe}}. To avenge his father. But such was not the way of twilight. He calmed himself as he realized the distance was too far... but only by the length of Shen's index finger.\n\nShen looked over at Zed, expecting to see him grin. Instead, his rival sighed. His skin was sallow, and dark folds hung beneath his eyes.\n\n''&quot;Five years, I have waited&quot;'', Shen said.\n\n''&quot;Have I misjudged the distance?&quot;'' Zed asked wearily.\n\n''&quot;Even if my head is cut off, I will still close and strike&quot;'', Shen said, sliding his foot backward and cocking it against the floor. Zed was ten paces and one half of a finger length away.\n\n''&quot;Your path's closer to mine. Your father's ideals were a weakness. Ionia could no longer afford them&quot;'', Zed said. He leaned back in his chair, keeping himself just outside of the range Shen would need to strike a killing blow. ''&quot;I know that's not something I can make you understand. But I will offer you a chance for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not act because of vengeance. You defy the balance. For that, you are damned&quot;'', Shen said as he inched forward to the edge of his chair.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Jhin|The Golden Demon}} escaped&quot;'', Zed replied.\n\n''&quot;Impossible.&quot;'' But Shen felt a hollowness had caught in his chest.\n\n''&quot;Your father's greatest victory. And now, again, his foolish mercy has tarnished his legacy.&quot;'' Zed shook his head. ''&quot;You know what that... thing is capable of.&quot;'' Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. ''&quot;And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him.&quot;''\n\nShen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.\n\nNow, that monster had returned.\n\nShen put his swords on the table. He looked down at the perfect bowl of soup in front of him. Little droplets of the pork fat's oil shimmered on its surface, but he wasn't hungry anymore.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|IV=\nThere was still no sign of {{ci|Zed}}. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. {{ci|Jhin}} needed to be careful.\n\nFrom the jetty, Jhin looked back to the foreign ship. The tide had come in, and the ship would be leaving in a few moments. He would have to return soon if he was going to perform in Zaun next month. Risk on top of risk.\n\nHe stopped to check his reflection in a puddle. From the water, a worried, elderly merchant stared back at him. Years of acting practice combined with his martial training had given him total control of his facial muscles. It was a common face, and he had given it an unexceptional expression. When he walked up the hill, Jhin blended easily into the crowd.\n\nHe checked the white lanterns above him, counting the distance. If Zed appeared, he would need them. At the inn on the top of the hill, he glanced at the planters where he had hidden {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|traps}}. Sharpened steel blades, shaped like flowers. They protected his escape route in case anything went wrong.\n\nHe thought of how the metal would slice through the crowd and splash the building's freshly painted teal walls with red. It was tempting.\n\nHe was pushing through the crowd when he heard the village elder speaking to {{ci|Shen}}.\n\n''&quot;Why would the demon attack her and the councilmen?&quot;'' the elder asked.\n\nShen, dressed in his blue outfit, didn't answer.\n\nAnother kinkou, a young woman named {{ci|Akali}}, stood beside Shen. She walked to the doorway of the inn.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', Shen said as he blocked her path.\n\n''&quot;What makes you think I'm not ready?&quot;'' Akali asked, annoyed.\n\n''&quot;Because I wasn't when I was your age.&quot;''\n\nAt that moment, a town guard stumbled from the entrance, his face pale and hollow.\n\n''&quot;Her flesh, it was... it was...&quot;'' he said. He took a few steps, then collapsed to the ground in shock.\n\n''&quot;He saw it. He saw the flower!&quot;'' Against the far wall, the tavern's owner laughed. Then he began weeping - his face painted by madness.\n\nThese were not people who would forget seeing Khada Jhin's work.\n\nShen scanned the faces of the onlookers.\n\n''Clever boy'', Jhin thought, before fading into the back of the crowd.\n\nHe checked the rooftops for Zed as he walked back to the ship.\n\nThe work was inescapable. Together or apart, Zed and Shen would chase the clues he had left. They would follow them back to the Blossom Festival. Back to Jyom Pass. And when they became desperate, then they would have to work together again.\n\nIt would be like it had been when they were young. They would huddle together in awe and fear.\n\nOnly then would the great Khada Jhin reveal himself...\n\nAnd his true masterpiece would begin.\n\n", "id": 202}, "Soraka": {"key": "Soraka", "name": "Soraka", "title": "the Starchild", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Soraka\n|alias        = * The Starchild\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nSoraka Render.png|Current\nSoraka Divine Render.png|Pre-Fall\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Fallen)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Ionia|Astral Grove]]\n|residence    = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Traveling Healer\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Warwick, Karthus\n|related      =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 16}, "Veigar": {"key": "Veigar", "name": "Veigar", "title": "the Tiny Master of Evil", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Veigar\n|alias        = * The Tiny Master of Evil\n|render       = [[File:Veigar Render.png|link=|260px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Warlock\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Lulu\n|rivals       = Teemo\n|related      = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 45}, "Janna": {"key": "Janna", "name": "Janna", "title": "the Storm's Fury", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Janna\n|real_name = Janna Windforce\n|alias = The Storm's Fury\n|weapon_pet = * {{ai|Zephyr|Janna}}\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1386.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Janna#Zephyr|Zyphyr]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n|render = Janna Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Piltover]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Weather Mage\n* Magical Regulator\n* &lt;small&gt;(Weather Reporter {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* Independent\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Do not be captivated by {{ci|Janna}}'s beauty.

Such a sorceress is Janna, who first learned magic as an orphan growing up amidst the chaos that is the city-state of [[Zaun]]. Janna eked out what living she could on the streets. Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren't enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of {{ai|Zephyr|Janna|air}}. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually overnight, stunning and surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension also changed her physical appearance, giving her an otherworldly look.\n\nSeeking to right the injustice in the world (particularly the insanity that has become the city of Zaun) Janna has brought her talents to [[the League]]. She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state of [[Piltover]] and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there.

What had once been heavy slabs of muscle in years gone by had slowly given way to fat, but he was still a big, intimidating man. His gaze was inscrutable, his eyes having long been replaced with soulless, reflective black lenses.\n\nA pair of heavily augmented bodyguards stood to either side of him. They were the best money could buy, their bodies having been turned into brutal chem-tech weapons by the brilliant, albeit deranged, scientist {{ci|Singed}}.\n\nTakeda's inherent violence and ambition had seen him rise from humble beginnings to become one of [[Zaun]]'s most powerful chem-barons, the infamous rulers of the undercity. Today he planned the downfall of yet another of his rivals.\n\n''&quot;Bring her in, Ortos&quot;'', he said, through a cloud of exhaled smoke.\n\nUnseen chains rattled and pulled taut, and the dark iron doors to his office ground open. Two more bodyguards stood to mute attention outside. One could never be too careful. Takeda had learned that the hard way, as his many scars attested.\n\nTakeda's shaven-headed chamberlain, Ortos, stepped forward, leading a petite figure to the entrance.\n\nShadows clung to her, making it difficult to see her clearly, though Takeda glimpsed a flash of blue-tinged flesh and a pair of {{ai|Agony's Embrace|Evelynn|predator's eyes}} that reflected the chem-fire sconces of his office. He felt an unfamiliar tremor of apprehension at her appearance, but forced it aside. He was one of the most feared men in Zaun. Why should he feel uneasy in his own office?\n\n''&quot;The Lady {{ci|Evelynn}}&quot;'', Ortos announced.\n\nTakeda waved a gloved hand, and Ortos retreated, the doors grinding shut behind him. Evelynn sauntered forward, moving with sublime grace, the heels of her boots echoing sharply.\n\nShe came to a halt on the other side of Takeda's wide desk, and planted her hands on her hips. He could see her more clearly as the shadows retreated to the corners of the room.\n\nHer slender figure was clad in gleaming red leather, and her eyes were yellow and almond-shaped, like those of a cat. A wild mane of crimson hair framed her face, and sharp canines glinted as her lips parted in a sardonic smile.\n\n''&quot;I've been called many things&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;but a lady? That's a new one.&quot;''\n\nTakeda leaned back in his seat, considering her. ''&quot;Around here, most call you the Widowmaker.&quot;''\n\nEvelynn shrugged. ''&quot;At least it's accurate.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I've never married, myself&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;But the one I want you to kill, the Baron Artega Holt, has a wife. Two of them, actually, and a throng of mistresses.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He sounds perfectly charming. I'm sure they'll miss him dearly&quot;'', purred Evelynn. ''&quot;I shall be glad to make his acquaintance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Before I commission you, I need some kind of assurance&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;How do I know you are the right one for this job?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You would have me prove myself, like some back-alley cut-throat?&quot;'' she asked, a hint of irritation in her voice. ''&quot;Has it been so long since I stepped foot in Zaun that I really need to audition?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We hear something of your exploits from time to time. That [[Demacia]]n knight-commander assassinated last year; that was you, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn gave a slow nod. ''&quot;It was.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And the heir of Clan Kozari, in [[Piltover]] last week?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn's expression hardened.\n\n''&quot;No, that was not me&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;That was the Gray Lady.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Ah&quot;'', mused Takeda. ''&quot;Interesting. Well, I guess it proves that reputations and gossip can never truly be relied upon. I'll trust what I see with my own eyes.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I'm afraid this might leave you disappointed&quot;'', hissed Evelynn.\n\nThe blue-skinned assassin took a step back and instantly {{ai|Shadow Walk|Evelynn|disappeared into shadow}}. Takeda's bodyguards tensed, flexing their piston-strengthened limbs in unease. Takeda glanced left and right, trying to discern her location. Nothing. She was simply gone, vanished completely, as if she had been swallowed by the darkness.\n\n''&quot;Not bad&quot;'', he said. He'd heard of her power, of course, but such things are often over-exaggerated. He was pleased to see that in this case, the rumors were true.\n\n{{ai|Ravage|Evelynn|Taloned hands}} grabbed him from behind, blood red nails digging into his flesh as Evelynn emerged from the shadows. She was far stronger than she looked, and forcibly turned his head to expose his thick neck. Her grasp was ice-cold, as if warm blood no longer flowed in her veins, and her fangs were inches from his jugular.\n\nHis guards turned instantly, stepping forward to defend their master, but Takeda raised a hand, stopping them in their tracks. He knew they would have been too slow had she truly wished to end his life.\n\n''&quot;What do you think?&quot;'' breathed Evelynn through bared teeth, her chilled breath caressing his throat. ''&quot;Impressed yet?&quot;''\n\nTakeda snorted.\n\n''&quot;Not bad at all&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;Yes, you will do nicely. Now, let us discuss my offer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I hope you can afford me&quot;'', she hissed, tightening her grip, and leaning closer. ''&quot;I don't want you to have wasted my time here.&quot;''\n\nTakeda swallowed uncomfortably. ''&quot;I don't think that will be an issue&quot;'', he said.\n\nEvelynn released him with a shove, and sat on the edge of his table. She stretched like a cat, completely at ease.\n\n''&quot;You haven't yet asked my price&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Whatever it is, I can pay it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Money holds no interest to me, Saito&quot;'', she said.\n\nTakeda furrowed his brow. ''&quot;Then what is it you want?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Much more than you will be willing to give, I'm thinking&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;But I believe you'll come around.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is not the way things work here&quot;'', growled Takeda. ''&quot;I own this district. No one makes demands of me.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You've seen only a fraction of what I can do&quot;'', said Evelynn. She leaned back, smiling. ''&quot;I'm in the perfect position to make a few demands.&quot;''\n\nTakeda said nothing. His body was tense. He opened his mouth to speak but Evelynn interrupted him, holding up a finger.\n\n''&quot;Don't say anything rash, my dear&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;You'd be dead before the words left your lips.&quot;''\n\nTakeda stared at her, frozen in indecision.\n\n''&quot;Very wise&quot;'', Evelynn said, after giving it a moment. She stood, moved back around the desk, and strode toward the door.\n\n''&quot;Artega Holt will be dead before sunup&quot;'', she said, without looking back. ''&quot;I'll be in touch about my first payment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'''First''' payment?&quot;'' said Takeda.\n\n''&quot;The first of many&quot;'', she said, pausing to look back at him. ''&quot;You'd be wise to remember that I can strike wherever there is darkness. And Zaun is such a dark place.&quot;''\n\nShe nodded toward the door, raising an eyebrow. Takeda growled an order, and the doors swung open. Before she left, Evelynn gave him a wink.\n\n''&quot;Don't take it too hard&quot;'', she said, as she melded into the darkness. ''&quot;So long as you don't irritate me, this partnership will work out well for us both.&quot;''\n\nTakeda sat alone in silence. After a few minutes, his chamberlain peered into the room.\n\n''&quot;Can I get you anything, my lord?&quot;'' Ortos said.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Saito Takeda through gritted teeth. He slammed a fist onto his desk. ''&quot;Leave me. All of you, leave me. And stoke the furnace.

His unquenchable thirst for stronger ale has led him in search of the most potent and unconventional ingredients to toss in his still. Impulsive and unpredictable, this rowdy carouser loves cracking kegs as much as cracking heads. Thanks to his strange brews and {{ai|Drunken Rage|Gragas|temperamental nature}}, drinking with Gragas is always a risky proposition.\n\nGragas has an eternal love of good drink, but his massive constitution prevented him from reaching a divine state of intoxication. One night, when he had drained all the kegs and was left wanting, Gragas was struck by a thought rather than the usual barstool: why couldn't he brew himself something that would finally get him truly drunk? It was then that he vowed to create the ultimate ale.\n\nGragas' quest eventually brought him to the [[Freljord]], where the promise of acquiring the purest arctic water for his recipe led him into uncharted glacial wastes. While lost in an unyielding blizzard, Gragas stumbled upon a great [[howling abyss]]. There he found it: a flawless shard of ice unlike anything he had ever seen. Not only did this unmelting shard imbue his lager with incredible properties, but it also had a handy side effect - it kept the mixture chilled at the perfect serving temperature.\n\nUnder the spell of his new concoction, Gragas headed for civilization, eager to share the fermented fruits of his labor. As fate would have it, the first gathering to catch Gragas' bleary eyes would shape the future of the Freljord. He blundered into a deteriorating negotiation between two tribes discussing an alliance with {{ci|Ashe}}. Though Ashe welcomed a break in the tension, the other warriors bristled at the intrusion and hurled insults at the drunken oaf. True to his nature, Gragas replied with {{ai|Body Slam|Gragas|a diplomatic headbutt}}, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.\n\nWhen the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas' brew. Although strife was averted and Gragas hailed a hero, he still had not achieved his dream of drunken blissfulness. So once more, he set off to wander the tundra in search of ingredients for [[Runeterra]]'s perfect pint.\n\n", "id": 79}, "Zed": {"key": "Zed", "name": "Zed", "title": "the Master of Shadows", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zed\n|alias        = * The Master of Shadows\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Razor Shuriken|Zed}}\n* {{ai|Death Mark|Zed|Shadow Blades}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Death Mark|Zed|(Plasma Cut 2250R Dual &quot;Strikers&quot;}}{{w|Alternative future|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Zed Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Ionia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Ionia|Kinkou Monastery]], [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Master of The Order of the Shadow \n*&lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiative member{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Ionia_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* The Order of the Shadow\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Syndra\n|rivals       = Shen, Akali, Kennen\n|enemies      = Gangplank, Jhin\n|related = [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 238}, "Vi": {"key": "Vi", "name": "Vi", "title": "the Piltover Enforcer", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Vi\n|render      = [[File:Vi Render.png|link=|225px]]\n|alias       = * The Piltover Enforcer\n* Fat Hands\n|weapon_pet  = * {{ai|Excessive Force|Vi|Hextech Gauntlets}}\n|gender      = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race        = Human\n|birthplace  = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence   = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation  = * Member of The [[Piltover]] Police Force \n* &lt;s&gt;[[Zaun]] gang member&lt;/s&gt;\n|friends     = Caitlyn, Jayce, Ezreal\n|rivals      = Jinx\n|faction     = * [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|related     = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/mayhem-everywhere-you-look/ Mayhem everywhere you look]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ", "id": 254}, "Lulu": {"key": "Lulu", "name": "Lulu", "title": "the Fae Sorceress", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lulu\n|alias = The Fae Sorceress\n|weapon_pet = * {{ai|Pix, Faerie Companion|Lulu|Pix}}\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1385.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Lulu#Pix.2C Faerie Companion|Pix]]  {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )\n|render = Lulu Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Formerly [[The Glade]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Sorceress\n* Trickster\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* Independent\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Gnar, Veigar\n|rivals = Tahm Kench\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The best path between two points is upside-down, between, then inside-out and round again.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lulu}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nPerhaps more than any other [[champion]] in [[the League]], Lulu marches to the beat of her own drum.\n\nDuring her youth in [[Bandle City]], she spent most of her time wandering alone in the forest or lost in a daydream. It wasn't that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn't compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked.\n\nThis was how she found {{ai|Pix, Faerie Companion|Lulu|Pix}}, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu's imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to [[the Glade]], the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods.\n\nThere the rigid properties of the outside world - things like {{ai|Wild Growth|Lulu|size}} and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place. She quickly lost track of time.\n\nHer life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were 'only pretend', and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal.\n\nLulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she'd learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away.\n\nLulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily {{ai|Whimsy|Lulu|changing}} them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn't appreciate her efforts.\n\nWhen the [[yordle]]s insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.\n\n", "id": 117}, "Taric": {"key": "Taric", "name": "Taric", "title": "the Shield of Valoran", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Taric\n|alias =\n* The Shield of Valoran\n* Oathbreaker\n* The Protector\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Bravado|Taric}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/KYpEU8rj-tarics-new-splash?comment=00010003 Reav3 confirms Taric wields a three-pronged mace]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[File:Bastion Buff.png|20px|link=]] Bastion\n|render = Taric Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]]\n|residence = [[Mount Targon]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(Protection)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;Demacian Knight&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Garen, Skarner, Sona\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/taric-comic/ The Ascent]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/taric.html Shield of Valoran]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The best weapons are beautiful.&quot;'' - {{ci|Taric}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nTaric is the Aspect of the Protector, wielding incredible power as [[Runeterra]]'s guardian of life, love, and beauty. Shamed by a dereliction of duty and exiled from his homeland [[Demacia]], Taric ascended [[Mount Targon]] to find redemption, only to discover a higher calling among the stars. Imbued with the might of ancient Targon, the Shield of Valoran now stands ever vigilant against the insidious corruption of [[the Void]].\n\n==Lore==\nExpected to serve as a stalwart guardian of Demacia, Taric's life was meant to be the model of focused, selfless dedication to the ideals of king and country. Though he always saw himself as a protector, he never felt the need to limit or define whom and what he protected - be it an ideal, a piece of art, or a stranger's life. Each could be considered worthy. Each could be seen as beautiful.\n\nMost of Taric's contemporaries were focused on the martial principles of battle (things that came naturally and effortlessly to him) The young warrior was drawn instead to the fragile wonders that give life meaning, not endless brutish contests for flag or crown.\n\nThis was a potentially treasonous philosophy, especially for one of Taric's standing and role within the Demacian military hierarchy, but he chose to dedicate himself to understanding the simple truths of love, beauty, and life, so he could become their champion. Admired by all, Taric used his disarming manner and innate warmth to charm his way past most obstacles, and on the rare occasion they failed, his skill with {{ai|Bravado|Taric|hammer}} and sword could be counted on to settle the matter.\n\nAs his quest for understanding broadened, Taric would miss combat training to wander the forest in search of a glimpse of a rare animal, neglect parade drills to sit in a tavern and listen to a bard's hauntingly simple ballad, and skip regimental meetings to take horseback rides to observe the silver cloak of night settle across the countryside. Taric knew that, in his own way, he was training in a manner just as dedicated and focused as his fellow Demacians, but it wasn't seen that way by his superiors.\n\nTaric's casual nature, disregard for orders, and disinterest in his patriotic calling finally put him at odds with nearly everyone in authority - his family, his king, and especially his long-time friend {{ci|Garen}}. And while the commoners saw Taric as a charming rogue, Garen recognized him for what he truly was - a man with the potential to become one of Demacia's greatest heroes. The fact that Taric seemed to be thumbing his nose at his destiny as well as his country enraged Garen.\n\nEventually, even his former friend could no longer protect him, and Taric's military career started to crumble. Demotion after demotion pushed Taric further from Demacia's heart, until, at last, he found himself commanding a small squad of lowly recruits assigned to guard an inconsequential ruined fortress out in the borderland wilds. After weeks spent standing in the rain and mud as ordered, and with no threat evident, Taric decided to let his men sleep while he wandered to a nearby temple to take in its cyclopean architecture.\n\nAs morning lit up the temple's overgrown cloisters, Taric finally decided to head back and check on his men. He was greeted by a scene of carnage. His troops had been butchered in their sleep, their corpses bearing the jagged hallmarks of the Void's monstrous predators.\n\nTaric had failed his men, his country, and most painfully, his self-avowed mission to protect life.\n\nReturning to Demacia in shame, Taric was stripped of his rank and sentenced by Garen to endure 'the Crown of Stone', a ceremony that demanded a dishonored soldier ascend Mount Targon, known to all as a death sentence, as few mortals had ever survived the climb.\n\nAnd while the Crown of Stone was traditionally used by the dishonored to simply flee Demacia and make a new life in exile, Taric decided to actually atone for his mistake and set out for the towering spire of Mount Targon.\n\nThe ascent nearly claimed him, body and soul, numerous times, but Taric pushed past the pain, past the memories of his mistake, the ghosts of his dead men, and other tests inflicted upon him by the mountain.\n\nAs he approached the summit, Taric was challenged by a seemingly neverending myriad of conflicting realities, each warped existence offering a new, horrifying vision. Taric experienced the infinite fates that could befall those who had no one to protect them in their times of crisis. He saw the Alabaster Library engulfed in pitch and flame, and still he dashed into the roiling inferno to retrieve the poetry of Tung. He screamed in rage as the [[File:ProfileIcon Frostguard.png|20px|link=]] Frostguard ran the last dreamstag off a blind cliff, and then leapt into the abyss himself in a desperate attempt to save it. Before the ebon gates of [[Noxus]], Taric slumped to his knees at the sight of Garen's shattered body chained aloft as a warning. Between Taric and his friend stood the sum total of Noxus' might. And yet still, without hesitation, Taric raised his [[File:Bastion Buff.png|20px|link=]] shield and drove all before him. Claiming Garen from the gates, the young warrior marched toward Demacia, heavy with his burden, knowing full well that his return would ensure his execution. As he walked, Taric looked upward - and the blood-strewn fields of Noxus gave way to the star-filled expanse above Mount Targon.\n\nHis trials complete, and freed from all illusion, Taric found himself at the pinnacle of the mountain, and he was not alone.\n\nBefore him, cut from the sackcloth of night itself, stood something wearing the shape of a man. Its features composed from the pinpoints of stars, Taric was struck by the odd familiarity of its nature.\n\nIts voice spoke in a thousand whispers that cut through Taric like a mountain wind. Though he heard no recognizable words, he understood the figure's intent with utter clarity.\n\nIt called itself 'the Protector'.\n\nImpressed by Taric's steadfast resolve, the otherworldly being deemed the fallen Demacian hero a worthy avatar, {{ai|Cosmic Radiance|Taric|imbuing him}} with its ethereal powers. The Protector spoke of the truths Taric had known his entire life, and of the mantle that he had unknowingly been preparing for with every decision that brought him to the top of the mountain.\n\nAs the Protector's whispers faded, Taric received a final warning: He would stand as the Shield of Valoran, but crashing against him would be a wave of howling madness, an ocean of gnashing teeth intent on consuming all, a squalid horror born of the Void.\n\nReborn with power and purpose, Taric gladly accepted the seemingly impossible challenge and now dedicates himself to his sworn duty - as the steadfast guardian of an entire world.\n\n;Uninvited Guest\nI look out across the once-verdant field, now scarred and ruined by the toil of battle.\n\nThe loss of life will be immense, but I cannot save those who seek their own destruction. All those sons, all those fathers, all those futures lost. [[Demacia]]ns and [[Noxus|Noxians]], ever at each other's throats, magnetically drawn to one another by something lesser than both.\n\nPlenty of defenders exist for their lofty ideals, and they all stand in my way, almost gleefully slaughtering themselves over a scrap of land, with no idea of its true importance. Two armies entwined, both committed to their ruinous dance.\n\nI could try to reason with them, ask them to move their brawl elsewhere, but my former countrymen now see me as something between a traitor and a wrathful god, and the Noxians... well, the Noxians have always been short on patience.\n\nMy usual weapons - wit, charm, and warmth - are useless in this cauldron of desperation. So I push aside those who would slow me, and wade into those who would stop me. Every kind of horror one soul can inflict on another rages around me as I near my goal.\n\nAnd there, dead center of the roiling fury of battle, the blaze of color calls to me - a delicate life about to be snuffed out amid the mud- and gore-covered boots. Standing bravely, unbowed by the thudding dullness of the armored brutes around it, its beauty rings out like a single crystal bell. It is the last flower of its kind. If it dies, no more shall bloom. I can not allow it to perish.\n\nThe two opposing commanders pause in their combat as I approach, an uninvited guest at their last moments. They turn to me, suddenly allied in their outrage at my intrusion.\n\nI stand at the very eye of the two armies, seemingly inviting the cold embrace of death from all sides. But unlike all those who are now taking wary steps toward me, their sword hands trembling, I know why I fight.\n\n;The Ascent\n\n: ''An exiled soldier ascends Mount Targon to find redemption, only to discover a higher calling.''\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\n01=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr01.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|02=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr02.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|03=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr03.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|04=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr04.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|05=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr05.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|06=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr06.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|07=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr07.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|08=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr08.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|09=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr09.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|10=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr10.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|11=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr11.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|12=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr12.jpg|center|700px]]\n\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 44}, "Quinn": {"key": "Quinn", "name": "Quinn", "title": "Demacia's Wings", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Quinn and Valor\n|alias = Demacia's Wings\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Harrier|Quinn|Crossbow}} &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Blinding Assault|Quinn|Claws}} &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Quinn Valor Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n{{w|Male|\u2642}} Male &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|race = \n* Human &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* Demacian Eagle &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Demacian Rural Town, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = Demacian Elite Ranger Team\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Jarvan IV\n|rivals = Talon\n|related = [[Journey into the Freljord]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;tabber&gt;\n\n00=\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Most soldiers only rely on their weapons.

The pair's unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents blind and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: not one, but two [[Demacia]]n legends.\n\nAs a young girl, Quinn shared a hunger for adventure with her twin brother. They dreamed of becoming knights, but lived a quiet, humble life in the rural borderlands of Demacia. Together they imagined triumphant battles in faraway lands, seizing glory for their king and slaying foes in the name of Demacian justice. When daydreams alone could no longer satisfy their warrior souls, they embarked on daring wilderness adventures in search of true danger. One such quest turned to tragedy when a terrible accident claimed her brother's life. Overcome with grief, Quinn abandoned her dreams of knighthood.\n\nOn the anniversary of her loss, Quinn gathered the courage to return to the scene of the tragedy. To her surprise, she found a wounded Demacian eagle at the site of her brother's death - a rare and beautiful bird long believed extinct. Quinn nursed the fledgling back to health, and as they grew up together, a deep bond formed between the two. She saw the same quality in her newfound friend that had lived within her brother, and so she gave him the name 'Valor'. The pair found strength in each other, and together they pursued the dream she had once abandoned.\n\nThe Demacian army had never seen heroes like Quinn and Valor. Their deadly skills quickly set them apart from their rank-and-file peers, but many still had their doubts. How could a common-born girl, even with such a powerful creature at her side, forego years of military training? Quinn and Valor proved themselves on one critical mission, tracking down a [[Noxus|Noxian]] assassin who had evaded an entire Demacian battalion. When they brought him to justice, they finally earned the admiration and respect of their nation. The two now serve as living, fighting icons of Demacian strength and perseverance.

Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government.\n\nIn those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power. While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus.\n\nWhen raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance.\n\nWhen LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: [[the League of Legends]].\n\n", "id": 7}, "Ezreal": {"key": "Ezreal", "name": "Ezreal", "title": "the Prodigal Explorer", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Ezreal\n|alias = \n* The Prodigal Explorer\n* Grandmaster Explorer\n* Professor Lyte's Nephew\n|weapon_pet = \n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal|(PEARL}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nEzreal Render.png|Current\nEzreal Explorer Render.png|Explorer\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Cartographer\n* Piltover Grandmaster Explorer\n* &lt;small&gt;(Pulsefire Warrior {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux, Jayce, Caitlyn, Vi\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/pulsefire-ezreal/en.html Pulsefire Armory]\n* [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima]\n* [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "he intrepid young adventurer {{ci|Ezreal}} has explored some of the most remote and abandoned locations on [[Runeterra]].
