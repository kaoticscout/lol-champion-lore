It remained there untouched for centuries, emanating a potent magic which infused nearby wildlife with sentience and vitality. A group of monkeys who were particularly empowered by it came to worship the stone, and their leader - a wise sage - became convinced that he could harness its power to make the monkeys immortal. He performed an elaborate ritual, but things didn't go as he expected. The runestone was destroyed, and instead of granting immortality, it produced Kong, a monkey who carried in his heart the strength and power it had contained. Kong was driven by an unquenchable desire for greatness. He sought out every beast and monster the Plague Jungles could offer, eager to find a worthy opponent, but none offered the challenge he craved. He asked the sage for advice, and learned about a legend of hairless monkeys to the north who, with wits and might, had bent the world to their will.\n\nKong left, journeying north, determined to discover if the legend was true. He crossed the Southern Wastes and then the Great Barrier. On his way, he happened upon {{ci|Master Yi}}, who was deep in meditation. Kong asked him who the strongest warrior in the north was, and Yi told him about [[the League of Legends]]. The tale intoxicated Kong, a place where he could battle the strongest fighters in the world was, to him, paradise. Kong asked Yi to introduce him to this League, and to teach him the ways of humans, so that he could be a fitting champion. In return, he would honor Yi by using Yi's Wuju style to become the greatest warrior Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed, but under the condition that Kong would one day teach the lessons of Wuju to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong ''Wukong,'' and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that the young Doran had crafted. The weapon was an unrivalled masterpiece. Guided by Yi, Wukong joined the League of Legends to prove himself as the best, and to show the world the true power of Wuju.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Only in combat do you learn who you truly are.&quot;|'''Wukong'''}}\n{{clr}}\n", "id": 62}, "Jax": {"key": "Jax", "name": "Jax", "title": "Grandmaster at Arms", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jax\n|alias = Grandmaster at Arms\n|weapon_pet = Brass Lamppost\n|render = Jax Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown \n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = Mercenary\n|faction = \n* Independent\n|allies = \n|friends = Gragas\n|rivals = Fiora\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Be advised - there has been an outbreak of lamppost-shaped bruises in [[the League of Legends]].&quot;'' - {{ci|Gragas}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIt is seldom the case where a [[champion]] is defined by his actions after joining the League of Legends rather than before. Such is the case with {{ci|Jax}}, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War.\n\nBefore joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.\n\nHis Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began. Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the [[Fields of Justice]]. The self-proclaimed 'Armsmaster of the League' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched.\n\nA number of [[summoner]]s in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable.\n\nFor this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under.\n\nThis was something the League had never done before, and something which has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways.\n\nThe League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n", "id": 24}, "Shaco": {"key": "Shaco", "name": "Shaco", "title": "the Demon Jester", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shaco\n|alias      = * The Demon Jester\n|render     = [[File:Shaco Render.png|245px|link=]]\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race       = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = * Homicidal Jester\n|faction    = * Independent\n|allies     =\n|friends    = Fiddlesticks, Nocturne\n|rivals     =\n|related    =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\n&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.---&gt;\n:''This lore is out-dated and is no longer considered {{w|canon}}.''\nMost would say that death isn't funny. It isn't, unless you're Shaco - then it's hysterical. He is [[Valoran|Valoran's]] first fully functioning homicidal comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is that Shaco is not of [[Runeterra]] - that he is a thing summoned from a dark and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation of humanity's dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at large.\n\nWhatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined [[the League of Legends]] for reasons only he knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned by both his fellow [[champion]]s and the media at large. Only the [[summoners]] in the [[Institute of War]] know why such a creature was allowed into the League, but most Runeterrans suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be to keep an eye on the ever-elusive Shaco. Unsurprisingly, this champion is popular in places where madness can openly reign, such as among the power-hungry summoners of [[Zaun]] and [[Noxus]].\n\n:''&quot;Whatever you do, don't tell him you missed the punch line.&quot;''\n{{clr}}\n\n", "id": 35}, "Warwick": {"key": "Warwick", "name": "Warwick", "title": "the Blood Hunter", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Warwick\n|alias = The Blood Hunter\n|render = Warwick Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Werewolf &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = \n* Manhunter\n* Researcher\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Singed\n|rivals = Vayne\n|enemies = Soraka\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Eventually the beast catches up with all of us.&quot;'' - {{ci|Warwick}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWarwick was once a man revered for his ability to {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|track down}} human specimens for the darkest types of scientific research.

Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner.\n\nTo meet their demands, Warwick needed the strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend, {{ci|Singed}}, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the [[Shadow Isles]], the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge.\n\nHe traveled to [[Ionia]] to trap {{ci|Soraka}}, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|raw strength}} and {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|heightened senses}}.\n\nExhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power.

The jungle was unforgiving, and she watched her parents suffer agonizing final days as they fell victim to a mysterious and vicious disease.\n\nAs improbable as it was for a child to survive in the inhospitable jungle by herself, she did just that.

Protected by a spiked shell, Rammus inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes - from [[Ascended|demigod]], to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the desert.\n== Lore ==\n\nSome believe {{ci|Rammus}} is an [[Ascended]] being, an ancient god amongst men who rolls to [[Shurima|Shurima\u2019s]] aid as an armored guardian in its times of need. Superstitious folk swear he is a harbinger of change, appearing when the land is on the verge of a great shift in power. Others speculate he is the last of a dying species that roamed the land before the Rune Wars sundered the desert with uncontrolled magic.\n\nWith so many rumors of great power, magic, and mystery surrounding him, Rammus compels many Shurimans to seek his wisdom. Soothsayers, priests, and deranged lunatics alike claim to know where Rammus dwells, but the Armordillo has proved elusive. Despite this, proof of his presence predates living memory, with crumbling mosaics depicting his image on the most ancient walls of Shuriman ruins. His likeness adorns colossal stone monuments made in the early days of Ascension, leading some to believe he is no less than an immortal demigod. Skeptics often point to a simpler explanation: that Rammus is just one of many such creatures.\n\nIt is said that he appears only to worthy pilgrims in great need of his aid, and those blessed by his presence experience great turning points. After the Armordillo rescued the heir to a vast kingdom from a terrible fire, the man renounced his position to become a goat farmer. An elderly mason was inspired by a profound, yet brief conversation with Rammus, and constructed an enormous marketplace which became the bustling heart of Nashramae.\n\nKnowing Rammus\u2019s guidance can pave an enlightened path, devout believers perform elaborate rituals designed to attract the favor of their deity. Disciples of the cult devoted to Rammus demonstrate their unwavering faith in a yearly ceremony by imitating his famous roll and somersaulting through the city in droves. Every year, thousands of Shurimans trek through the most treacherous and remote corners of the desert on a quest to find Rammus, for many teachings indicate he will answer a single question of those he finds deserving, if they are able to find him. Knowing his enthusiasm for desert treats, the pilgrims arm themselves with offerings thought to attract his blessing, packing their mules with flasks of sweet goat\u2019s milk, chests filled with colonies of ants sealed in wax, and jars of honeycombs. Many never return from the deep desert, and fewer still with stories of the demigod, though travelers describe waking to find their packs mysteriously emptied of all edible provisions.\n\nWhether he is truly a wise oracle, Ascended deity, or a mighty beast, Rammus is known for his miraculous feats of endurance. He entered the impenetrable Fortress of Siram, an imposing bastion designed by a crazed sorcerer. The structure was said to contain untold magical horrors - fearsome beasts mutated beyond recognition, corridors wreathed in flames, impenetrable tunnels guarded by shadow demons. Not an hour had passed when the enormous fortress collapsed in a plume of dust, and Rammus was seen rolling away. None knew why Rammus entered the darkened gate, nor what secrets he learned within the basalt walls of the fortress. In the year of the great flood he crossed the vast lake of Imalli in just two days, and dug many miles deep to destroy a giant anthill and kill its queen, whose daughters had devastated the nearby farmland.\n\nSometimes he appears as a benevolent hero. When invading [[Noxus|Noxian]] warbands attacked a Northern Shuriman settlement, disparate tribes banded together to defend the territory beneath the Temple of the Ascended. They were no match for the invaders in size or skill, and the battle was all but lost when Rammus entered the fray. Each side was so shocked to see the elusive creature that fighting halted completely as they watched him roll between them. As Rammus passed the towering temple, the foundations of the building shook, and enormous stone blocks toppled onto the invading army, crushing many of its warriors. Now outnumbered, the army retreated to elated cheers from the Shurimans. While many swear Rammus saved the town out of love for Shurima, others argue he was merely defending the territory in which his favorite cactus flowers grew. At least one tribesman claims Rammus was simply sleeprolling and had no intention of taking down a temple.\n\nWhatever the truth, stories of Rammus are treasured by the people of Shurima. Any Shuriman child can list a dozen theories on the question of his origin, half of which they likely invented on the spot. Tales of the Armordillo have only increased with the rise of Ancient Shurima, as they did just before its fall, giving way to a belief that his presence heralds darker times to come.\n\nBut how can such a benevolent, epicurean soul herald an age of destruction?\n\n", "id": 33}, "Illaoi": {"key": "Illaoi", "name": "Illaoi", "title": "the Kraken Priestess", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Illaoi\n|render = Illaoi Render.png\n|alias = \n* The Kraken Priestess\n* Truth Bearer of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|Eye of God}}\n* {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Buhru, [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]]\n|residence = Rat Town, [[Bilgewater]]\n|occupation = \n* Priestess of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}\n* &lt;small&gt;(Void Bringer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Bilgewater Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Bilgewater]]\n* [[File:Illaoi Relic.png|20px|link=]] Nagakabouros\n|allies = \n|friends = Gangplank, Miss Fortune, Graves, Twisted Fate\n|enemies = Nautilus, Hecarim, Mordekaiser, Yorick, Thresh, Karthus\n|related = \n*[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/champions/trial-of-the-kraken-priestess Trial of the Kraken Priestess]\n* [[Shadow and Fortune]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head.&quot;'' - {{ci|Illaoi}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIllaoi's powerful physique is dwarfed only by her indomitable faith.

Before [[the League]], he served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions which would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good {{w|dogfight}} in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement which he felt 'cut the engines and clipped the wings'. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him. When Heimerdinger joined the [[League of Legends]], it was no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test his mettle against the best the world has to offer.\n\n", "id": 42}, "Braum": {"key": "Braum", "name": "Braum", "title": "the Heart of the Freljord", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Braum\n|alias = The Heart of the Freljord \n|render = Braum Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Iceborn]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Freljord]]\n|residence = \n|occupation = \n* Goat Herder \n* Legendary Tale Hero \n* &lt;small&gt;(Wrestler {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord_Avarosan.png|15px|link=]] [[Avarosan]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; (Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Ashe, Tryndamere, Gragas \n|rivals = Lissandra\n|related = \n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/braum/ The Feats of Braum]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/trials-poro/ Trials of the Poro]\n}}\n\n", "background": "=Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\nMain=\n\n[[File:The Heart of the Freljord.png|left|250px]]\n\n''&quot;Would you like a bedtime story?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Grandma, I'm too old for that.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You're never too old to be told a story.&quot;''\n\nThe girl reluctantly crawls into bed and waits, knowing she won't win this battle. A bitter wind howls outside, whipping falling snow into devil whirls.\n\n''&quot;What kind? A tale of {{ci|Lissandra|the Ice Witch}}, perhaps?&quot;'' her grandmother asks.\n\n''&quot;No, not her.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What about a story of {{ci|Braum}}?&quot;'' She was met with silence. The old woman smiles. ''&quot;Oh, there are so many. My grandmother used to tell me of the time Braum protected our village from the great dragon! Or once - this was long ago - he raced down a river of lava! Or -'' She pauses; puts a finger to her lips. ''Have I told you how Braum got {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum|his shield}}?&quot;''\n\nThe girl shakes her head. The hearth fire snaps, holding off the wind.\n\n''&quot;Well. In the mountains above our village lived a man named Braum - &quot;''\n\n''&quot;I know that!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He mostly kept to his farm, tending his sheep and goats, but he was the kindest man anyone had ever met, and he always had a smile on his face and a laugh on his lips.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Now, one day something terrible happened: a young troll boy around your age was climbing the mountain and happened on a vault, set into the mountainside, the entrance guarded by a huge stone  door with a shard of True Ice at its center. When he opened the door, he couldn't believe his eyes: the vault was filled with gold, jewels - every kind of treasure you could imagine!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What he didn't know was that the vault was a trap. {{ci|Lissandra|The Ice Witch}} had cursed it - and as the troll boy entered, the magical door {{sbc|clanged}} shut behind him and locked him inside! Try as he might, he couldn't get out.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A passing shepherd heard his cries. Everyone rushed to help, but even the strongest warriors couldn't open the door. The boy's parents were beside themselves; his mother's wails of grief echoed around the mountain. It seemed hopeless.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And then, to everyone's surprise, they heard a distant laugh.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It was Braum, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Aren't you clever! Braum had heard their cries and came striding down the mountainside. The villagers told him of the troll boy and the curse. Braum smiled, nodded, turned to the vault, and faced the door. He pushed it. Pulled it. Punched it; kicked it; tried to rip it from its hinges. But the door wouldn't budge.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But he's the strongest man ever!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It was perplexing&quot;'', her grandmother agrees. ''&quot;For four days and nights, Braum sat on a boulder, trying to think of a solution. After all, a child's life was at stake.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then, as the sun rose on the fifth day, his eyes widened and a broad grin lit up his face. 'If I can't go through the door', he said, 'then I'll just have to go through - ' &quot;''\n\nThe girl thinks; her own eyes widen. ''&quot; ' - the mountain!' &quot;''\n\n''&quot; 'The mountain'. Braum headed to the summit and began punching his way straight down, pummeling into the stone, fist after fist, rocks flying in his wake, until he had vanished deep into the mountain.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;As the villagers held their breath, the rock around the door crumbled - and when the dust cleared, they saw Braum standing amidst the treasure, the weak but happy troll boy in his arms.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I knew he could do it!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But before they could celebrate, everything began to rumble and shake: Braum's tunnel had weakened the mountaintop, and now it was caving in! Thinking quickly, Braum grabbed the enchanted  door and held it above him like a shield, protecting them as the mountaintop collapsed all around them. When it was over, Braum was amazed: there wasn't a single scratch on the door! Braum knew it was something very special.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And from that moment on, that magical shield never left Braum's side.&quot;''\n\nThe girl is sitting upright, struggling to conceal her excitement.

Where others succumbed to the harshness of the [[Freljord]], she was tempered by it until pain became power, hunger an encouragement, and frost an ally in culling the weak. Through her ordeals, she learned that to thrive in the endless winter, one must become just as cold and unforgiving. In Sejuani's eyes, her followers either have the mettle to endure or the right to die. Once she has conquered the Freljord, she knows that those who survive will form a nation to be feared.\n\n", "background": "s a child, the leader of the Winter's Claw watched her tribe's numbers slowly dwindle. Cold and starvation took all but the most resilient. She was the only one of her siblings to survive to her tenth year, leaving Sejuani sure that she too would die in misery. In desperation, she sought spiritual counsel from her tribe's mystic. But the seer did not foretell Sejuani's death. Instead, she prophesized that Sejuani would one day conquer and unite the divided tribes of the Freljord.\n\nArmored with absolute faith in her destiny, Sejuani pushed herself to extremes that would have killed anyone without her will to endure. She walked into blizzards without food or furs and trained while frigid winds raked her flesh. She clashed with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs gave out beneath her. When she assumed leadership of her tribe, Sejuani commanded her warriors to follow her example. Under her rule, the tribe grew stronger than they had ever been.\n\nIn the end, it was an offer of peace - rather than an act of war - that began Sejuani's campaign of conquest. On the first day of winter, envoys from {{cis|Ashe}} tribe approached Sejuani's camp bearing a gift of Avarosan grain. Ashe's intent was clear: if Sejuani united with her tribe, the Winter's Claw would never go hungry again. To Sejuani, the gift was an insult. In Ashe's tribe, she saw men and women, slight and soft, who preferred to farm instead of fight. Her contempt for them was absolute.\n\nSejuani gathered her people and set the grain alight. She proclaimed that Ashe's offer of charity would bring only weakness. Stripping the envoys of their supplies, Sejuani sent them back with a message: the Winter's Claw would prove to the Avarosan that only the strong deserve to survive in the Freljord.

One such battle changed his life forever. Raiders ambushed Tryndamere's clan in the dead of night, and though his warriors were able to push the first wave of attackers back, they weren't prepared for the {{ci|Aatrox|dark figure}} that next stepped forth.

The dark figure swatted him aside, mortally wounding the young barbarian.\n\nTryndamere saw death and destruction engulf his home as his life slipped away. No one was left standing - only the screams of the dying remained. Unable to surrender to death, Tryndamere gave in fully to his wrath. His blood boiled and his anger consumed him, banishing his mortality. He staggered to his feet - barely able to take hold of his sword - steeling himself for the decisive confrontation with the shadowy being.

For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nThe boy who would eventually be called Xerath was born a nameless slave in Shurima thousands of years ago. He was the son of captured scholars, with only the prospect of endless servitude ahead. His mother taught him letters and numbers, while his father told him tales from history in the hopes that such skills might allow him a better life. The boy vowed he would not end up bent-backed and whipped like every other slave.\n\nWhen the boy\u2019s father was crippled during the excavations for the foundations of a monument to the Emperor\u2019s favorite horse, he was left to die at the site of the accident. Fearing her son would suffer a similar fate, the boy\u2019s mother begged an esteemed tomb architect to take him on as an apprentice. Though at first reluctant, the architect was impressed with the boy\u2019s eye for detail and innate understanding of mathematics and language, and accepted. The boy never saw his mother again.\n\nHe was a swift learner and his master dispatched him on errands to the Great Library of {{ci|Nasus}} to retrieve specific texts and plans on an almost daily basis. On one trip, the boy met {{ci|Azir}}, the least-favored son of the emperor. Azir was struggling to read a difficult passage in an ancient text, and, despite knowing that to talk to royalty was to invite death, the boy paused to help the young prince with its complex grammar. In that moment, a tentative friendship was established, and over the coming months that friendship only grew stronger.\n\nThough slaves were forbidden names, Azir gave one to the boy. He named him Xerath, which means \u2018one who shares,\u2019 though that name was only ever spoken between the two boys. Azir saw to it that Xerath was appointed to his household\u2019s slaves, and made him his personal attendant. Their shared love of knowledge saw them devour texts from the library and become as close as brothers. Xerath was Azir\u2019s constant companion, learning all he could from this new proximity to culture, power and knowledge, finally daring to dream that Azir might one day free him.\n\nOn the annual tour of the emperor\u2019s dominion, assassins struck the royal caravan as it spent the night at a well-known oasis. Xerath saved Azir from an assassin\u2019s blade, but Azir\u2019s brothers were all slain, leaving the young prince a heartbeat away from Shurima\u2019s throne. As a slave, Xerath could expect no reward for his deed, but Azir promised that one day they would be as brothers.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination attempt, Shurima endured years of horror and fear of the emperor\u2019s retribution. Xerath knew enough of history and the workings of the Shuriman court to understand that Azir\u2019s life hung by the slenderest of threads. That he was heir to the throne meant nothing, for the emperor hated Azir for living while his more beloved sons had died. Of more immediate danger, the emperor\u2019s wife was still young enough to bear other children, and thus far she had borne many healthy sons. The odds were good that she would produce another male heir for her husband, and as soon as she did, Azir\u2019s life was forfeit.\n\nThough Azir was a scholar at heart, Xerath persuaded him that to survive, he must also learn to fight. This Azir did, and in return the young heir elevated Xerath, insisting he continue his education. Both youths excelled, and Xerath proved to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, one who took to the pursuit of knowledge with gusto. Xerath became Azir\u2019s confidant and right-hand man, a position unheard of for a mere slave. This position gave him great - and some said, undue - influence over the young prince, who came to rely on Xerath\u2019s judgement more each day.\n\nXerath bent his every effort into seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it, no matter the cost, no matter its source. He unlocked long-sealed libraries, delved into forgotten vaults and consulted with mystics entombed deep beneath the sands; all to further his knowledge and ambition, both of which grew with unchecked rapidity. Whenever the whispers around court that spoke of his delving into unsavory places grew too loud to ignore, he would find cunning means to silence them. That Azir never mentioned these whispers was, to Xerath, tacit approval of how he was keeping his emperor safe.\n\nYears passed, and Xerath took ever darker steps to keep the emperor\u2019s wife from carrying a child to term, using his nascent magical abilities to corrupt every infant in the womb. Without rivals to the throne, Azir would be safe. When rumors of a curse arose, Xerath ensured they were never spoken again, and ofttimes those who had voiced such suspicions vanished without trace. By now, Xerath\u2019s desire to escape his roots as a slave had become a burning ambition to achieve power of his own, though he justified every murderous act by telling himself he was doing it to keep his friend alive.\n\nDespite Xerath\u2019s best efforts to thwart the queen\u2019s midwives, a new prince of Shurima was brought into the world, but on the night of his birth, Xerath used his growing magical powers to summon the elemental spirits of the deep desert and craft a terrible storm. Xerath brought bolt after bolt of lightning down upon the queen\u2019s chambers, reducing it to burning rubble and killing the queen and her newborn son. The emperor rushed to his queen\u2019s chambers, only to be confronted by Xerath, his hands ablaze with arcane power. The emperor\u2019s guards attacked, but Xerath burned them and the emperor to cindered skeletons. Xerath ensured that the mages of a conquered territory were blamed for these deaths, and Azir\u2019s first act upon taking the throne was to lead a brutal campaign of retribution against its people.\n\nAzir was crowned emperor of Shurima with Xerath at his side, the boy who had once been a nameless slave. Xerath had long dreamed of this moment, and expected Azir to end slavery in Shurima before finally naming him brother. Azir did none of these things, continuing to expand his empire\u2019s borders and deflecting Xerath\u2019s overtures regarding the end of slavery. To Xerath, this was further proof of Shurima\u2019s moral bankruptcy, and he raged at Azir\u2019s breaking of his promise. Azir\u2019s face was thunderous as he reminded Xerath that he was a slave and should remember his place. Something once noble died in Xerath that day, but he bowed in supplication, outwardly accepting Azir\u2019s decision. As Azir continued his campaigns of conquest, Xerath remained at his side, but his every action was carefully designed to increase his influence over a realm he now planned to take for himself. To steal an empire was no small thing, and Xerath knew he needed more power.\n\nThe famous legend of Renekton\u2019s Ascension revealed that a mortal did not have to be chosen by the Sun Priests, that anyone could rise up. So Xerath plotted to steal the power of Ascension. No slave could ever stand upon the sun disc, so Xerath fed the Emperor\u2019s vanity, inflating his ego and filling his head with impossible visions of a world-spanning empire. But such a dream would only be possible if Azir could Ascend as the greatest heroes of Shurima had before. In time Xerath\u2019s perseverance paid off, and Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that he had earned the right to stand alongside Nasus and Renekton as an Ascended being. The Sun Priests protested, but such was Azir\u2019s hubris that he ordered them to comply on pain of torture and death.\n\nThe Day of Ascension arrived and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension with Xerath at his side. Nasus and Renekton were absent from the day\u2019s events, for Xerath had arranged a distraction for them by weakening the seal on a magical sarcophagus containing {{ci|Brand|a beast of living fire}}. When that creature finally broke its bindings, Renekton and Nasus were the only warriors capable of defeating it. Thus Xerath had stripped Azir of the only two beings who might save him from what was to come.\n\nAzir stood beneath the sun disc and in the final moment before the priests began the ritual, events took a turn Xerath had not anticipated. The emperor turned to Xerath and told him that he was now a free man. He and all Shurima\u2019s slaves were now released from their bonds of servitude. He embraced Xerath before naming him his eternal brother. Xerath was stunned. He had been given everything he desired, but the success of his plans hinged upon Azir\u2019s death and nothing was going to dissuade him from acting. Too many pieces were in motion and Xerath had already sacrificed too much to turn back now \u2013 no matter how much that part of him wanted to. The emperor\u2019s words pierced the bitterness enclosing Xerath\u2019s heart, but came decades too late. Unaware of his peril, Azir turned as the priests began the ritual and brought down the awesome power of the sun.\n\nWith a roar of anger and grief combined, Xerath blasted Azir from his place on the dais, watching through tears as his former friend burned to ash. Xerath took Azir\u2019s place and the light of the sun filled him, reshaping his flesh into that of an Ascended being. But the power of the ritual was not his to take, and the consequences of his betrayal of Azir were devastating. The unbound power of the sun all but destroyed Shurima, sundering its temples and bringing ruination upon the city. Azir\u2019s people were consumed in a terrifying conflagration as the desert rose up to claim the city. The sun disc fell and an empire built by generations of emperors was undone in a single day.\n\nEven as the city burned, Xerath held the sun priests in the grip of his magic, preventing them from ending the ritual. The energies filling him were immense, alloying with his dark sorcery to create a being of incredible power. As he drew ever more of the sun\u2019s power into his body, his mortal flesh was consumed and remade as a glowing vortex of arcane power.\n\nWith Xerath\u2019s treachery revealed, {{ci|Renekton}} and {{ci|Nasus}} rushed to the epicenter of the magical storm destroying the city. They bore with them the magical sarcophagus that had imprisoned the spirit of eternal fire. The Ascended brothers fought their way to the Dais of Ascension just as Xerath fell from the deadly radiance engulfing the city. Before the newly-Ascended Magus could react, they hurled his crackling body within the sarcophagus and sealed it once more with blessed chains and powerful sigils of binding.\n\nBut it was not enough. Xerath\u2019s power had been great as a mortal, and that power - combined with the gift of Ascension - made him all but invincible. He shattered the sarcophagus, though its shards and chains remained bound to him. Renekton and Nasus hurled themselves at Xerath, but such was his newfound strength that he fought them both to a standstill. The battle raged throughout the collapsing city, destroying what had not already sunk beneath the sands. The brothers were able to drag Xerath toward the Tomb of Emperors, the greatest mausoleum of Shurima, a vault whose locks and wards were impossible to break and which answered only to the blood of emperors. Renekton wrestled Xerath within and called upon Nasus to seal the vault behind them. Nasus did so with heavy heart, knowing it was the only way to prevent Xerath\u2019s escape. Renekton and Xerath fell into eternal darkness, and there they remained, locked in an endless battle as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed.\n\nUncounted centuries passed and, in time, even Renekton\u2019s mighty strength waned, leaving him vulnerable to Xerath\u2019s influence. With poisoned lies and illusions, Xerath twisted Renekton\u2019s mind, filling him with misplaced bitterness toward Nasus, the faithless brother who had - in Xerath\u2019s fictive narrative - abandoned him so long ago.\n\nWhen the Tomb of Emperors was finally discovered beneath the desert and broken open by Sivir and Cassiopeia, both Xerath and Renekton were freed in an explosion of sand and rubble. Sensing his brother still lived, Renekton charged from the ruins, his distorted mind leaving him little better than a savage beast. After an age lost to legend, Shurima was reborn, and as it rose majestically from the desert, Xerath felt another soul return to life beneath the sand, one he had thought long dead. Azir was also newly resurrected as one of the Ascended, and Xerath knew there could be no peace for either of them while the other yet lived.\n\nXerath sought the heart of the desert to regain his strength and understand how the world had changed in the millennia since his imprisonment. His stolen power grew with every passing moment, and he beheld a world ripe for conquest, a world brimming with mortals ready to worship at the feet of a new and terrible god.\n\nYet for all his newfound power, however far he has come from that nameless slave boy, a part of Xerath knows he is still in chains.\n\n", "id": 101}, "Sivir": {"key": "Sivir", "name": "Sivir", "title": "the Battle Mistress", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Sivir\n|alias  = The Battle Mistress\n|render = Sivir Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|The Chalicar}}\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Shurima]]\n|residence = Shuriman Capital, [[Shurima]]\n|occupation = \n* Mercenary\n* Heiress of [[Shurima]]\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shurima Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shurima]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Azir, Nasus, Taliyah\n|enemies = Cassiopeia, Xerath\n|related = \n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima] \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKnM6Hh5gOg/ Descent into the Tomb]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYyuH1Bp2ZI/ Rise of the Ascended]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/sivir Battle Mistress]\n* [[Bloodline]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;I don't care what face is on your coin, as long as it pays.&quot;'' - {{ci|Sivir}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSivir is a renowned fortune hunter and mercenary captain who plies her trade in the deserts of [[Shurima]].

It was with committed faith in this ideal that Riven strove to greatness. She showed early potential as a soldier, forcing herself to master the weight of a long sword when she was barely its height. She was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. \n\nRiven became a leader amongst her peers, poster child of the Noxian spirit. So exceptional was her passion that the High Command recognized her with a black stone rune sword forged and enchanted with Noxian sorcery. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad - perfectly suited to her tastes. Soon after, she was deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion.\n\nWhat began as war quickly became extermination. Noxian soldiers followed the terrifying Zaunite war machines across fields of death. It wasn't the glorious combat for which Riven trained. She carried out the orders of her superiors, terminating the remnants of a beaten and fractured enemy with extreme prejudice.\n\nAs the invasion continued, it became clear that the Ionian society would not be reformed, merely eliminated. During one bitter engagement, Riven's unit became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the enemy closed in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by {{ci|Singed}}. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate.

This fascination compelled her to begin training to become such a champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered, wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous chances which ultimately led to her tragic demise. '''Orianna's''' death shattered Corin, driving him into deep depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand the void his daughter's death left in his life, so he decided to build a replacement \u2013 one that would complete '''Orianna's''' dream of joining the League. What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his daughter.

Bearing a hammer twice the length of her body, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching for the ''Hero of Demacia,'' a fabled warrior said to be the rightful wielder of her weapon.\n\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nAs legend describes it, this hero is the only person who can unlock the full power of the hammer and lead Demacia to true greatness. Though Poppy has searched the furthest corners of the kingdom for this legendary fighter, her quest has proven fruitless. Each time she has attempted to pass the hammer on to a potential hero, the results have been disastrous, often ending in the warrior\u2019s death. Most people would have abandoned the task long ago, but most people do not possess the pluck and resolve of this indomitable heroine.\n\nPoppy was once a very different yordle. For as long as she could remember, she had been in search of a purpose. Feeling alienated by the chaotic whimsy of other yordles, she preferred to soak up stability and structure where she could find it. This drive brought her to the human settlements of western Valoran, where she gazed in wonder at the caravans striping the countryside in an endless file. Many of the people there looked tattered and weary, but they stumbled on in pursuit of some ephemeral better life that might lie just beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, however, a different sort of caravan passed through. Unlike the other travelers, these people seemed to move with purpose. They all awoke at exactly the same time each morning, roused by the sound of a watchman\u2019s horn. They took their meals together every day at the same hour, always finishing within a few minutes. They set up their camps and took them down with remarkable efficiency.\n\nWhile yordles used their innate magic to fashion extraordinary things, these humans achieved equally astounding feats through coordination and discipline. They acted in concert like the cogs of a gear, becoming something much larger and stronger than any single person could ever be. To Poppy, that was more marvelous than all the magic in the world.\n\nAs Poppy watched the camp from the safety of her hiding place, her eyes caught the gleam of armor emerging from a tent. It was the group\u2019s commanding officer, wearing a brigandine of gleaming steel plates, each piece overlapping, each an integral part of the whole. The man\u2019s name was Orlon, and his presence seemed to stir the souls of everyone there. If someone became discouraged, he was there to remind them of why they pressed on. If someone collapsed from exhaustion, he inspired them to get up. It reminded Poppy of certain yordle charms, though again, without magic.\n\nPoppy crept in for a closer look. She found herself following this shining commander, as if drawn to him by fate itself. She observed Orlon as he led his soldiers in training exercises. He was not a large fellow, yet he swung his massive battle hammer with surprising alacrity. At night, Poppy listened intently to his hushed discussions with the elders of the camp. She heard them making plans to pull up stakes and head west to build a permanent settlement.\n\nPoppy\u2019s mind was overwhelmed with questions. Where was Orlon going? Where did he come from? How did he assemble this meticulous band of travelers, and was there a place for a yordle in it? At that moment, she made the most important decision in her life: For the first time ever, she would reveal herself to a human, as this was the first time she\u2019d ever felt a connection with one.\n\nThe introduction was a jarring one, with Orlon having just as many questions for Poppy as she had for him, but the two soon became inseparable. He became a mentor to her, and she a devotee to his cause. In the training grounds, Poppy was an invaluable sparring partner\u2013the only member of Orlon\u2019s battalion who was unafraid to strike him. She was never obsequious, questioning his decisions with an almost childlike innocence, as though she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to meekly follow orders. She accompanied him to the site of the new settlement\u2013an ambitious new nation called Demacia, where all were welcome, regardless of station or background, so long as they contributed to the good of the whole.\n\nOrlon became a beloved figure throughout the kingdom. Though few had actually seen him wield his hammer, he always bore it on his back, and the weapon quickly became a revered icon for the fledgling nation. People whispered that it had the power to level mountains and tear the earth itself asunder.\n\nOrlon passed the hammer to Poppy on his deathbed, and with it, his hope of an enduring kingdom. It was only then that Orlon told her the story of his weapon\u2019s creation, and how it was never truly intended for his hands. He explained to Poppy that the hammer was meant to go to the Hero of Demacia\u2013the only one who could keep Demacia whole. As her friend drew his last breath, Poppy swore to him that she would find this hero and place the weapon in his hands.\nBut what Poppy possesses in resolve, she lacks in ego, as it never even occurred to her that she might be the hero Orlon described.\n\n", "id": 78}, "Karthus": {"key": "Karthus", "name": "Karthus", "title": "the Deathsinger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Karthus\n|alias = The Deathsinger\n|render = Karthus Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Lich &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Death Worshipper\n* Death Preacher\n* &lt;small&gt;(Singer for [[Pentakill (band)|Pentakill]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Mordekaiser, Thresh\n|rivals = Soraka\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/karthus?_k=hds01n Deathsinger]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Death is not the end of the journey, it is just the beginning... &quot;'' - {{ci|Karthus}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance.

The boy and his Yeti searched far and wide for a place they\u2019d both be welcome, and eventually found a home among the Avarosan.\n\nSometimes bonds of friendship become stronger than even bonds of blood. When those bonds link a fearless boy to a fearsome Yeti, the bond becomes a force to be reckoned with. Given the responsibility of taming a terrifying beast, Nunu forged a friendship where others would have forged chains. Now Nunu and his burly pal Willump are an inseparable pair who combine youthful exuberance and brute strength with the mythical powers of the Yeti to overcome obstacles insurmountable to any ordinary duo.\n\nNunu had only the vaguest memories of his parents or the time before he was part of the reclusive Frostguard tribe. Never welcome among his caretakers, Nunu's wanderlust and compassion often put him at odds with the tribe's elders and the boy frequently dreamed of places far beyond the shadow of the Frostguard citadel. Sometimes he would do more than just dream, much to the frustration of his minders. This was never more apparent than when Nunu was apprenticed to the tribe's beast master and charged with the care of the creatures under his yoke.\n\nThe Frostguard held a menagerie of the [[Freljord|Freljord's]] wildlife at their beck and call, but unique among their collection was the Yeti: an uncommon creature with mystical qualities and raw physical strength. The beastmaster taught Nunu that it was only a lean diet of plants and regular whippings that kept the vicious beast tame, but the more time Nunu spent caring for the creature, the more he learned that the Yeti was no feral monster.\n\nAs he saw his new friend Willump growing weaker and sicker, Nunu began to sneak the Yeti scraps of meat, hoping to restore his health. Day by day, Willump grew stronger and not the slightest bit savage contrary to the beastmaster's claims. Nunu had hopes of convincing him that the Yeti possessed no danger, but it wasn't meant to be. The next time Nunu came to deliver Willump a meal, he found the Yeti's cage shattered,with only a crude drawing inside signaling the Yeti's farewell. Without hesitation, Nunu rushed into the wilderness in search of his friend.\n\nWhen Nunu finally caught up to Willump, he found the Yeti cornered by the beastmaster alongside a group of Frostguard warriors. Afraid that the men would hurt his friend, Nunu threw himself between the Yeti and the beastmaster's lash, but the brutal man would not stay his hand. As the furious beastmaster raised his whip once more, the Yeti swelled up with uncharacteristic fury. Even after so much mistreatment, it wasn't concern for himself but for the boy who'd shown him kindness that finally pushed Willump too far. The Yeti raged and left the man bloodied in the snow.\n\nTerrified by Willump's fury, the remaining Frostguard warriors fled. Nunu realized there was no going back. He yelled at Willump to run before the men returned to kill him, but the Yeti refused to leave the young boy. Nunu was faced with a hard choice: abandon his sole friend and lead a life of captivity with the Frostguard,or strike out into the harsh wilds and leave behind the only home he knew. Nunu chose the only path that made sense. Leaping onto the back of the mighty Yeti, Nunu joined Willump in his great escape. The pair took their first steps into the wide world from which they had been kept for so long.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Willump and I have a whole world to explore.

There is nothing he can't beat into submission and bend to his will, not even the ice itself. With his massive, frozen club, he chills his enemies to the core and runs them through with jagged shards of ice. Fiercely territorial, Trundle chases down anyone foolish enough to enter his domain and laughs as they bleed into the [[Freljord|tundra]].\n\nTrundle's warband once followed a foolish and cowardly chieftain. Under such a weak leader, Trundle feared he and his kin would fall prey to the other troll hordes scattered across the tundra. When his challenge to the chieftain ended in humiliation, Trundle did something that wasn't very troll-like: instead of his fist, he turned to his wits. Thinking on his hairy feet, he spun a tall tale about the troll leaders of old, claiming they wielded weapons of great power as symbols of their right to rule. Though he'd made up the story on the spot, Trundle wagered that if he could find or steal such a weapon, he would become the rightful leader of the warband. The trolls believed him, but none thought him capable of undertaking such a challenge. Knowing the boastful troll would die trying, the foolish chieftain agreed and Trundle departed to the familiar sound of laughter.\n\nAlone but undaunted, Trundle ventured into the foreboding realm of the dreaded {{ci|Lissandra|Ice Witch}}. There, hidden among the many ancient and dangerous secrets, he hoped to find a weapon to prove his elaborate tale. He out-muscled the Ice Witch's guards and outsmarted her dark magic traps, but nothing he scavenged matched the power he'd described to his kin. Finally, he found an unexpected prize: a huge and magical club of never-melting True Ice. Grasping the weapon, he marveled at the cold power that ran through him. But then the wrathful Ice Witch herself appeared. As she summoned her dark magic, Trundle believed he had met his end, but another clever idea struck him. With a knowing grin, he offered the Ice Witch a devious proposition: a troll army, he told her, would be of much more use to her than one troll corpse...\n\nWhen Trundle returned to the warband, his fellow trolls bowed to his conquest. Calling his weapon &quot;Boneshiver,&quot; he took a moment to enjoy the look of numb shock on his chieftain's face before he caved it in. Seizing command, Trundle announced that there would no longer be chieftains - only a Troll King before whom all of his kind would kneel. The trolls rallied behind their brash, new leader and prepared for the coming war. With Trundle leading the charge, the time of the trolls had finally come.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Outsmart anyone you can't beat, and beat anyone you can't outsmart.&quot;|'''Trundle'''}}\n\n", "id": 48}, "Graves": {"key": "Graves", "name": "Graves", "title": "the Outlaw", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Graves\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nGraves Render.png|Current\nGraves Cutthroat Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|real_name = Malcolm Graves\n|alias = The Outlaw\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|New Destiny|Graves}}\n* &lt;s&gt;{{ai|True Grit|Graves|Destiny}}&lt;/s&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Bilgewater]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Mercenary\n* Thief\n|friends = Twisted Fate, Illaoi\n|rivals = \n|faction = \n* Independent\n|related = [[Burning Tides]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;We're here for your gold, not your heads, so don't nobody decide to be a hero.&quot;'' - {{ci|Graves}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nMalcolm Graves is a wanted man in every realm, city-state, and empire he has visited.

Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n\n{{ci|Renekton}} was born to fight. From a young age he was constantly getting into vicious brawls. He had no fear, and was able to hold his own against much older children. It was often pride that led to these confrontations, as Renekton was unable to back down, or let any insult pass. Every evening, he came home with cuts and fresh bruises, and while his more scholarly older brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, disapproved of his street-fighting, Renekton relished it.\n\nNasus soon moved away, having been chosen to join the elite Collegium of the Sun, and in the years he was absent, Renekton\u2019s skirmishes became increasingly serious. On a rare visit home, Nasus was horrified to see his bloodied young brother return home from yet another street fight. Fearing Renekton\u2019s violent nature would see him imprisoned or in an early grave, Nasus helped him enlist in the Shuriman army. Officially, Renekton was too young for this duty, but his older brother\u2019s influence smoothed away this detail.\n\nThe discipline and regimentation of the army was a blessing for Renekton. Within a few years, he rose to become one of Shurima\u2019s most feared and capable war-captains, and he fought on the front line in numerous wars of conquest to expand the empire. He garnered a reputation for ferocity and toughness, but also for honor and bravery. Nasus became a decorated general, and the two of them served in a number of campaigns together, remaining very close despite their inherent differences and frequent disagreements. Nasus\u2019s skill lay in strategy, logistics and history; Renekton\u2019s lay in battle. Nasus planned the wars, and Renekton won them.\n\nRenekton earned the title Gatekeeper of Shurima after fighting a desperate battle in one of the mountain passes bordering Shurima. An invading force had landed on the south coast, striking toward the isolated city of Zuretta. If it was not halted, the city was certain to be razed, and its populace massacred. Outnumbered ten to one, Renekton and a small contingent faced these aggressors, determined to buy time for the city to be evacuated. It was a battle that none expected Renekton to survive, let alone win. He held the pass for a day and a night, long enough for a relief force led by Nasus to arrive. With barely a handful of warriors left standing, none uninjured, Renekton was hailed a hero.\n\nRenekton served on the frontlines for decades, and never lost a battle. His presence was inspiring to those fighting alongside him, and terrifying to his enemies. Victory after victory were his, and such was his reputation that some wars were won without a sword even being lifted, enemy nations surrendering as soon as they heard Renekton was marching on them.\n\nRenekton was of middling years, a grizzled and battle-scarred veteran, when word reached him that his brother was close to death. He raced back to the capital to find Nasus a pale shadow of his former self, having been struck down by a debilitating wasting malady. The sickness was incurable, similar to the rotting curse said to have cut down an entire noble line in antiquity.\n\nNevertheless, Nasus\u2019s greatness was recognized by one and all. As well as being a highly decorated general, he curated the great library of Shurima, and penned many of the finest literary works in the empire. The priesthood proclaimed it to be the sun\u2019s will that he undertake the Ascension ritual.\n\nThe whole city gathered to witness the holy rite, but the tragic illness had taken a terrible toll, and Nasus no longer had the strength to scale the stairs to the Ascension dais. In the ultimate act of self-sacrifice and love, Renekton lifted his brother in his arms, and climbed the final steps, fully expecting to be obliterated in the process by the holy energies of the sun disc. He deemed his sacrifice a small thing to ensure that his brother would live on. He was just a warrior, after all, albeit a talented one, while his brother was a peerless scholar, thinker and general. Renekton knew that Shurima would need Nasus in the years to come.\n\nRenekton was not destroyed, however. Beneath the blinding radiance of the sun disc, both brothers were raised up and remade. When the light faded, two mighty Ascended beings stood before the onlookers, Nasus in his lean, jackal-headed body, and Renekton in his immense, crocodilian form. Their forms seemed apt; the jackal was often regarded as the most clever and cunning of beasts, and the fearless aggression of the crocodile fit Renekton perfectly. Shurima gave thanks to have these new demigods as guardians of the empire.\n\nRenekton had been a mighty war hero before, but now he was an Ascended being, blessed with power beyond mortal understanding. He was stronger and faster than any regular man, and seemed virtually immune to pain. Though Ascended beings were not immortal, their lifespans were dramatically increased, so that they might serve the empire for hundreds of years.\n\nWith Renekton at the head of the Shuriman armies, the empire\u2019s military was all but unstoppable. He had always been a ruthless commander and ferocious fighter, but his new form gave him power beyond belief. He led the soldiers of Shurima to many bloody victories, neither giving nor expecting mercy. His legend spread far beyond the borders of the empire, and it was his enemies that gave him the name Butcher of the Sands, a title he embraced.\n\nThere were those, Nasus among them, who came to believe that a portion of Renekton\u2019s humanity had been lost in his transformation. As the years progressed, he seemed to become crueler, relishing the spilling of blood more than was natural, and whispers circulated of atrocities he committed in the name of war. Nevertheless, he was a staunch defender of Shurima, and he faithfully served a succession of emperors, ensuring the security and greatness of Shurima for hundreds of years.\n\nDuring the reign of the Emperor {{ci|Azir}}, word arrived that a magical {{ci|Brand|being of fire}} had escaped the {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|magical sarcophagus}} that bound it in its underground prison. It had laid waste to a Shuriman town, before fleeing across the desert to the east. Renekton and his brother Nasus set forth to recapture this legendary foe. While they were absent, the young emperor, guided by the manipulations of his magus, {{ci|Xerath}}, attempted to join their ranks and become one of the Ascended. The results were catastrophic.\n\nReneketon and Nasus were a day\u2019s ride from the capital, but even so, they felt the shockwave as the Ascension ritual went awry. Knowing that something terrible had come to pass, they raced back to find the glorious city in ruins. Azir had been killed, along with most of the city\u2019s populace, and the great sun disc was falling, drained of all its power.  At the epicenter of the ruin, they encountered Xerath, now a being of pure, malevolent power.\n\nThe brothers sought to bind Xerath in the magical sarcophagus that had held the ancient being of fire. For a day and a night they battled, but the magus was powerful, and would not be held. He shattered the sarcophagus, and assailed them with spells fueled by the power of sun disc, which crashed to the ground as they fought.\n\nKnowing that they could not destroy Xerath, Renekton finally wrestled him into the depthless Tomb of the Emperors, and bade his brother seal them inside forever. Knowing there was no other way to stop Xerath, Nasus reluctantly did as his brother ordered. As Renekton and Xerath fell into darkness, Nasus sealed the tomb for all eternity.\n\nIn the darkness, Xerath and Renekton continued their battle. For uncounted years they fought, as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed to dust in the world above. Xerath whispered poison in Renekton\u2019s ear, and gradually, as the centuries rolled on, his viperous words and the ever-present darkness took its toll. The magus implanted the notion in Renekton\u2019s mind that Nasus had sealed him in on purpose, jealous of his success, and unwilling to share his Ascension.\n\nPiece by piece, Renekton\u2019s sanity cracked. Xerath drove a wedge into these cracks, corrupting his mind and twisting his perception of what was real and what was imagined.\n\nThousands of years later, the Tomb of the Emperors was opened by the mercenary {{ci|Sivir}}, freeing Renekton and Xerath. Renekton roared his fury and thundered out into the Shuriman desert, sniffing the air for the scent of his brother.\n\nRenekton now roams the deserts, seeking the death of Nasus, the traitor he believes left him to die. His grip on reality is tenuous at best, and while there are moments when he resembles the proud, honorable hero of the past, much of the time he is little more than a devolved hate-maddened beast, driven on by the thirst for blood and vengeance.\n\n", "id": 58}, "Darius": {"key": "Darius", "name": "Darius", "title": "the Hand of Noxus", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Darius\n|alias = The Hand of Noxus\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nDarius Render.png|Current\nDarius Lord Render.png|Formal\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Military General\n* &lt;small&gt;(Basketball Player {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Swain, Draven\n|rivals = Katarina, Draven, Vladimir\n|enemies = Garen\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;A united Noxus could control the world - and would deserve to.&quot;'' - {{ci|Darius}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere is no greater symbol of [[Noxus|Noxian]] might than Darius, the nation's most feared and battle-hardened warrior.

Darius' captain called for his troops to retreat, but Darius refused to accept such an act of cowardice. Breaking formation, Darius strode towards the captain and {{ai|Noxian Guillotine|Darius|decapitated him}} with one sweep of his gigantic axe. Both terrified and inspired, the soldiers followed Darius into battle and fought with incredible strength and fervor. After a long and grueling battle, they ultimately emerged victorious. Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops in a devastating campaign against Demacia.\n\nAfter proving his power on the battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation's strength. Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to reshape the Noxian leadership. He identified weak figureheads and violently removed them from their positions of power.\n\nMany in Noxus saw Darius' cull as an attempt to seize power, but he had a different plan for the throne. He had been watching the rise of {{ci|Swain|Jericho Swain}} with keen interest. In Swain, Darius saw a leader with the mind and determination to bring Noxus to glory.

A manic and impulsive criminal, she despises nothing more than boredom, and gleefully unleashes her own volatile brand of pandemonium to the one place she finds dullest: [[Piltover]]. With an arsenal of deadly toys, she unleashes the brightest explosions and loudest blasts - all the better to shock and surprise the hapless authorities. Always just out of the law's reach, Jinx's favorite game is to toy with Piltover's finest - especially {{ci|Vi}}.\n\nPiltover had long been known as the City of Progress, a place where peace and order reigned. That serenity was challenged when a new kind of criminal arrived, the likes of whom had never been seen. This mysterious outlaw unleashed a series of warped and destructive capers that endangered the entire city, and left its people reeling from the worst crime spree in Piltover's history.\n\nAs the string of crimes without rhyme or reason hit the city, sightings of the lawbreaker emerged. Though the young woman's origins were a mystery, some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms, while others described the street fashions of [[Zaun]] in her dress. Because her arrival always brought trouble with it, those who crossed her path soon gave her a name: {{ci|Jinx}}.\n\n[[File:Jinx graffity of Vi.png|right|275px]]\n\nJinx's rampage escalated. {{ci|Caitlyn}} - the sheriff of Piltover - responded by declaring a state of emergency and organizing a city-wide manhunt. In typical Jinx fashion, the criminal marked the Piltover treasury, the city's most secure building, with a direct challenge to its most abrasive officer. With a caricature of Vi's face splashed across the treasury's facade, and with a time and date of her supposed raid, Jinx was openly daring the enforcer to stop her from robbing it.\n\nDetermined to put the troublemaker behind bars, Vi watched and waited outside the treasury until Jinx's time had finally come. True to her scrawled promise, the smiling menace showed her face. Knowing this was her chance to capture the outlaw, Vi gave chase into the building's interior. She smashed through wall after wall to chase down Jinx, who giggled as she lit up the evacuated treasury with fiery explosions. Vi finally cornered the criminal inside the vault, but Jinx wasn't done just yet. With a maniacal laugh, she fired a barrage of rockets, bringing the entire building down upon them both.\n\nWhen Vi finally crawled out of the ruins, the battered enforcer found no trace of Jinx. Adding insult to injury, not a single ounce of gold had been taken from the ruined vault. Instead, the criminal left a parting message to her favorite officer of the law - a challenge only now visible through the gaping opening in Piltover's skyline. The lights of the city spelled out a simple taunt: you'll never catch me.

His victims suffer far beyond the point of death, for Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his lantern to torture for all eternity.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nIn an age history has all but forgotten, the man who would later be known as Thresh was once a member of an order devoted to gathering and protecting knowledge. The masters of this order tasked him with guarding a hidden underground vault filled with dangerous and corrupted magical artifacts. Thresh was incredibly strong-willed and methodical, which made him well-suited to such work.\n\nThe vault Thresh guarded was buried deep beneath the citadel at the center of an island chain and protected by runic sigils, arcane locks and potent wards. Spending such time in the presence of dark spells began to affect Thresh as the magic sought out his innate malice. For years the relics preyed on his insecurities, taunting him with his deepest fears and feeding his bitterness.\n\nThresh\u2019s spite surfaced through wanton acts of cruelty, as his talent for exploiting vulnerability bloomed. He slowly tore pages out of a living book, binding it back together when it was all but spent. He scratched the glass of a mirror bound with the memory of an ancient mage until it was opaque, trapping the man in darkness, only to polish it anew and repeat. Just as a secret wants to be told, a spell wants nothing more than to be cast, and Thresh denied this each day. He would start to recite an incantation, then let the words trickle off his tongue, halting just before the last syllable.\n\nHe became exquisitely skilled at covering all evidence of his cruelty, such that no one in the order suspected he was anything other than a disciplined guard. The vault had grown so vast that no one knew its contents as completely as Thresh, and the lesser artifacts faded from the order\u2019s memory, as did Thresh himself.\n\nHe resented that he had to hide his meticulous work. Everything under his watch was evil, or corrupted in some way - why shouldn\u2019t he be free to do as he would?\n\nThe vault held many peculiar magical artifacts but no people, until one day when a chained man was dragged into the sunken catacombs. He was a warlock who had infused his body with raw sorcery, which gave him the power to regenerate his flesh, no matter how grievous the wound.\n\nThresh was delighted at his new ward - a being who could feel the full range of human suffering, but would not perish, a plaything he could torment for years to come. He started methodically separating the warlock\u2019s skin from his flesh with a hook, and used his chains to lash and tear the open wound until it healed. He took to wearing the chains as he patrolled the vault, reveling in the warlock\u2019s fear at the long, dragging sound of his approach.\n\nWith ample charges to torment in the vault, Thresh became even more distanced from the order above. He began to take his meals in his underground chamber lit by a single lantern, rarely emerging from the catacombs. His skin developed a pallid complexion from lack of sunlight, and his face became gaunt and hollow. Members of the order avoided him, and when a series of mysterious disappearances plagued the order, none thought to investigate Thresh\u2019s lair.\n\nWhen the disaster known as the Ruination struck, magical shockwaves claimed the lives of all who lived on the isles and transformed them into a state of undeath. While others screamed in anguish, Thresh reveled in the ruin. He rose from this cataclysm as a spectral abomination, but unlike many who have passed into the shadow world, Thresh did not lose his identity. Rather, his penchant for cruel torture and ability to discern weakness was only heightened.\n\nHe relished the chance to continue his cruelty without fear of reprisal, unfettered by the limits of mortality. As a wraith, Thresh could torment the living and the dead endlessly, delighting in their despair before claiming their soul for an eternity of suffering.\n\nThresh now seeks only particular victims: the most clever and resilient, and those with a strong will. His greatest joy comes from tormenting his victims until they lose any last glimmer of hope, before facing the inevitable hook of his chains.\n\n", "id": 412}, "Kayle": {"key": "Kayle", "name": "Kayle", "title": "The Judicator", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kayle\n|alias = The Judicator\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|Holy Sword}}\n* {{ai|Intervention|Kayle|Holy Magic}}\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nKayle Render.png|Masked\nKayle Unmasked Render.png|Unmasked\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Angel\n|birthplace = \n|residence = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Galio\n|rivals = Morgana\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;In [[the League of Legends]], Justice comes on swift wings.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIn a world far away where an ancient war still rages, {{ci|Kayle}} was a great heroine - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found.\n\nFor ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly for her people, wielding {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|her flaming sword}} forged before time itself.

The Berserker lives only for the roar of a battle cry and the clash of steel. Spurred on by his hunger for glory and the looming curse of a forgettable death, Olaf throws himself into every fight with reckless abandon. Surrendering to the bloodlust deep within his being, Olaf is only truly alive when grappling with the jaws of death.\n\nThe coastal peninsula of [[Lokfar]] is among the most brutal places in the [[Freljord]]. There, rage is the only fire to warm frozen bones, blood is the only liquid that flows freely, and there is no worse fate than to grow old, frail, and forgotten. Olaf was a warrior of Lokfar with no shortage of glories and no hesitation to share them. While boasting one evening with his clansmen over the burning embers of a razed village, one of the elder warriors grew tired of Olaf's bluster. The old fighter goaded Olaf to read the omens and see if Olaf's fortunes matched his gloating. Emboldened by the challenge, Olaf mocked the aged raider's envy and tossed the knuckle bones of a long-dead beast to predict the heights of glory he'd achieve in death. All mirth left the gathering as the clansmen read the portents: the bones spoke of a long life and a quiet passing.\n\nInfuriated, Olaf stormed into the night determined to prove the prediction false by finding and slaughtering Lokfar's feared frost serpent. The monster had consumed thousands, man and ship alike, in its long lifetime and to die in battle with it would be a fitting end for any warrior. As Olaf hurled himself into the blackness of its maw, he fell deeper into the blackness of his mind. When the shock of freezing water roused him from the dark, there was only the butchered carcass of the beast afloat beside him. Thwarted but not defeated, Olaf set out to hunt down every legendary creature with claws and fangs, hoping that the next battle would be his last. Each time he charged headlong toward his coveted death, only to be spared by the frenzy that washed over him while on its brink.\n\nOlaf concluded that no mere beast could grant him a warrior's death. His solution was to take on the most fearsome tribe in the Freljord: the [[File:ProfileIcon Winter's Claw.png|20px]] '''Winter's Claw'''. {{ci|Sejuani}} appeared amused by Olaf's challenge to her warband, but his audacity would earn him no mercy. She ordered the charge and sent scores of her warriors to overwhelm Olaf. One by one, they fell until he lost himself in the bloodlust once again, effortlessly cutting a path to the leader of the Winter's Claw. The clash between Olaf and Sejuani rocked the glaciers with its force, and though he seemed unstoppable, Sejuani battled the berserker to a standstill. As they stood deadlocked, Sejuani's glare penetrated Olaf's berserker haze in a way no weapon ever could. His frenzy abated long enough for her to make him an offer: Sejuani swore that she would find Olaf his glorious death if he would lend his axe to her campaign of conquest. In that moment, Olaf vowed he would carve his legacy into the Freljord itself.\n\n{{quote|&quot;When you meet your ancestors, tell them Olaf sent you.&quot;|'''Olaf'''}}\n{{clr}}\n", "id": 2}, "Ziggs": {"key": "Ziggs", "name": "Ziggs", "title": "the Hexplosives Expert", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Ziggs\n|alias        = * The Hexplosives Expert\n* Dean Ziggs\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Bouncing Bomb|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Satchel Charge|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Hexplosive Minefield|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Mega Inferno Bomb|Ziggs}}\n|render       = [[File:Ziggs Render.png|260px|link=]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation   = * Scientist\n* Inventor\n* Dean of Demolitions\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n* [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Heimerdinger, Rumble\n|rivals       = Tahm Kench\n|related      =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\n{{cbi|Ziggs}} was born with a talent for tinkering, but his chaotic, hyperactive nature was unusual among [[yordle]] scientists.

With each passing day, her mastery of magical force grows more potent and devastating. Refusing any notion of balance or restraint, Syndra wants only to retain control of her power, even if it means annihilating the [[Ionia#Government|authorities]] that seek to stop her.\n\nThroughout her youth in Ionia, Syndra's reckless use of magic terrified the elders of her village. They took her to a remote temple, leaving her in the care of an old mage. To Syndra's delight, the mage explained that the temple was a school\u2014a place where she could develop her talents under his guidance. Though she learned much during her time there, Syndra no longer felt her power growing as it had in her youth. Her frustration grew, and she finally confronted her mentor, demanding an explanation. He revealed that he had dampened Syndra's magic, hoping to help her learn control and restraint. Accusing him of betrayal, she advanced on the mage, commanding him to lift the spell that was holding her back. He backed away, telling her that if she couldn't control herself, he would be forced to nullify Syndra's magic completely. Furious, she summoned her power and dashed the old man against the walls. With her mentor dead, Syndra felt the rush of her unbounded potential for the first time in years. Though she had won her freedom, she refused to return to the society that had tried to steal her gift. Instead, Syndra decided to claim her former prison as a stronghold. Pushing the boundaries of her magic, she tore the structure from its foundations and raised it into the sky.

Instead, he had an unquenchable desire to inflict pain through experimentation. By the time he was five, most of the pets in the [[Zaun]] neighborhood where Mundo grew up had gone missing. By his teenage years, his parents were nowhere to be found. By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.\n\nDr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer, an accomplishment that [[Noxus]] noticed. The empire was impressed by his ambition, and recruited his talents to initiate a relationship between the two nations.\n\nHe continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking.

A strong leader torn between tradition and revolution, Karma seeks to protect the peace of Ionia - by force if necessary.\n\nKarma once lived a tranquil life in a small Ionian village. Led by elder monks, the villagers practiced a tradition of benevolent magic and pacifism. Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\n\nHer inner peace was tested when the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded Ionia. While the village's elder monks insisted their peaceful ways would spare them from violence, Karma had heard enough tales of Noxian cruelty to openly question the elders' wisdom. Stern and unmoving, they told her to trust in tradition.\n\nWhen the invaders marched on the village, the elder monks rode out to negotiate a bloodless end to the battle. The Noxian general was offended by their show of weakness and slaughtered the monks himself as he ordered his soldiers to strike the village.\n\nAs the Noxians advanced, the villagers prepared to accept death, bound to their peaceful vows. But Karma would not accept death and instead saw another way: sacrificing a single life to spare many others.\n\nTo save her people, she drew upon {{ai|Mantra|Karma|the power within}} and summoned the full force of her will. {{ai|Soulflare|Karma|A burst of spirit fire}} emerged from her body and spiraled towards the Noxian general.\n\nThe flame took the form of {{ai|Gathering Fire|Karma|twin dragons}}, the symbol of Ionia itself. It was the first time Karma had ever used her powers to harm instead of protect, and neither she nor the villagers had ever seen anything like it.\n\nWhen the magic subsided, the general had fallen before her and his soldiers had scattered. The opposing forces surrendered to Karma's strength leaving her people, and their traditions, untouched.\n\nWhile the war raged on, Karma became a formidable leader of the Ionian resistance, but the conflict did not end when Noxus' armies fled the Ionian shores.\n\nIonia became divided between the resistance fighters who craved vengeance and the monks who demanded a return to spiritual tradition. Karma saw a third path, one that combined the strength Ionia found in war with the peaceful traditions the nation still held dear.\n\nShe now seeks to return her ravaged land to an enduring peace.\n\n", "id": 43}, "Annie": {"key": "Annie", "name": "Annie", "title": "the Dark Child", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Annie\n|real_name = Annie Hastur\n|alias = The Dark Child\n|weapon_pet = {{moi|Tibbers}}\n|render = Annie Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|residence = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* The Grey Order\n|allies = \n|friends = Amumu\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "here have always been those within [[Noxus]] who did not agree with the evils perpetrated by the [[Noxian]] High Command.

These political and social outcasts, known as the Grey Order, sought to leave their neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge.\n\nThe leaders of this outcast society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Grey Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch.

At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorceled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet.

Their leader is a furious adversary who commands the force of lightning to strike fear within his foes: Volibear. Both a warrior and a mystic, Volibear seeks to defend the ancient ways and the warrior spirit of his tribe.\n\nThough history recorded their once legendary feats in battle, the Ursine now lived in tranquil seclusion. The warriors were headed by a triumvirate of leaders who maintained a long-lived isolation, avoiding the petty affairs and conflicts of others. As shaman to the three, Volibear was a respected sage known for his insight. It was an era of unprecedented peace, but Volibear felt dread stirring within him. Prosperity was turning the tribe soft and weak, and many had long forgotten the sacred art of war. In time, Volibear felt the fire of their souls would be extinguished. When he revealed his misgivings to the triumvirate, they refused to listen and warned him to know his place.\n\nSeeking wisdom, Volibear undertook a perilous climb to the peak of the Ursine's sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. The eye of the storm was said to bestow portents, and legend held that the tempest would mark the next great chieftain of the tribe. As Volibear ascended the peak, he was struck by an unnatural bolt of lightning. When the shaman awoke, he was possessed by a horrific vision of the Freljord utterly consumed by darkness. Volibear saw an unprepared and complacent Ursine force slaughtered by [[Watcher|terrible creatures of ice]]. In an instant, he knew his race would perish if they did not prepare for war.\n\nVolibear rushed down the mountainside to recount what he had seen, but found the path blocked by three Ursine - the triumvirate. Knowing he would end the lasting peace, they refused to heed Volibear's warning and demanded his silence, by his word - or his death. Resolute and adamant, Volibear swore that the Ursine's very survival depended on his message, and launched into ferocious combat against the three. A terrible clash ensued, and just as Volibear succumbed to his opponents, he {{ai|Thunder Claws|Volibear|called upon}} the power of the maelstrom. Unleashing raw lightning, he struck the trio down with a thunderous blow. Stunned and astonished, the triumvirate beheld the sign of Ursine leadership: the force of the sacred storm.\n\nRecognizing his foretold ascendance, the triumvirate appointed Volibear as the Ursine's new leader. His influence was swift and decisive: he roused his tribe from complacency, revived their battle-hardened traditions, and allied with {{ci|Sejuani}}, the warrior who would fight with them against {{ci|Lissandra|the coming evil}}. With time, the tribe grew lean and fierce, becoming known again as fearsome warriors of legend.

With the world turned against him, he will do everything in his power to bring the guilty to justice and restore his honor.\n\nOnce a brilliant pupil at a renowned [[Ionia]]n sword school, Yasuo was the only student in a generation to master the legendary wind technique. Many believed he was destined to become a great hero. However, his fate was changed forever when [[Noxus]] invaded. Yasuo was charged with guarding an Ionian Elder, but, foolishly believing his blade alone could make the difference, left his post to join the fray. By the time he returned, the Elder had been slain.\n\nDisgraced, Yasuo willingly turned himself in, prepared to pay for his failure with his life. He was shocked, however, to find himself accused not just of dereliction, but of the murder itself. Though confused and racked with guilt, he knew the assassin would go unpunished if he did not act. Yasuo raised his sword against the school and fought his way free, knowing his treason would turn all of Ionia against him. Now truly alone for the first time in his life, he set out to find the Elder's real killer.\n\nYasuo spent the next several years wandering the land, seeking any clue that might lead him to the murderer. All the while, he was relentlessly hunted by his former allies, continually forced to fight or die. His mission drove him ever forward, until he was tracked down by the one foe he dreaded most \u2013 his own brother, Yone.\n\nBound by a common code of honor, the two warriors bowed and drew their swords. Silently they circled one another under the moonlight. When they finally charged forward, Yone was no match for Yasuo; with a single flash of steel he cut his brother down. Yasuo dropped his weapon and rushed to Yone's side.\n\nOvercome with emotion, he demanded to know how his own kin could think him guilty. Yone spoke: \u201cThe Elder was killed by a wind technique. Who else could it be?\u201d Understanding swept over Yasuo as he suddenly realized why he had been accused. He professed his innocence once more and begged his brother's forgiveness. Tears streamed down Yasuo's face as his brother passed in his arms.\n\n[[File:Yasuo.png|right|250px]] Yasuo buried Yone under the rising sun, but could take no time to mourn. Others would be after him before long. His brother's revelation had given Yasuo newfound purpose; he now had the clue that would lead to the true killer.

Combining brute strength with limitless flexibility, he is a versatile juggernaut: a creative fighter who bounces over obstacles and pounds his foes into submission. Though he was created inside a weapons laboratory, Zac was rescued and adopted by two loving parents who raised him to be a kind and friendly child. As the years passed, he grew up to be a fierce hero, sworn to protect the ordinary, everyday people of Zaun.\n\n", "background": "ong ago, two Zaun scientists developed an organic substance that could withstand extreme conditions, spontaneously alter its biological structure, and generate tremendous amounts of kinetic force. As the scientists, husband and wife, watched the prototype grow from a spoon-sized droplet to a small blob, they noticed that their creation would respond to their presence. It sprung forward when they called and bounced when they sang. The couple began to see more than an experiment; they saw a small child, filled with affection and joy.\n\nAfter testing the prototype one evening, the scientists placed the blob back in its cage. It slouched and shuddered in the corner, inconsolably sad. At that moment, the couple realized that their beloved creation wished for a free life outside the lab. They were struck by their conscience and could not allow the prototype to be used as a weapon. The husband and wife fled with the young blob, replacing its weapon designation \u2013 Zaun Amorphous Combatant \u2013 with a proper name: Zac. In a quiet neighborhood far from the cities of Zaun, the scientists raised Zac as their own child.\n\n[[File:Zac picture 2.png|thumb|150px]]\nZac was always different from the other children. None had his powers of strength and flexibility, so the couple taught him to tell right from wrong and to use his gifts responsibly. Thanks to the care and affection of his loving parents, Zac lived a peaceful, happy childhood.\n\nThat childhood ended when the Zaun laboratory finally found Zac. Unable to replicate the formula used to create the amorphous prototype, the laboratory's staff never stopped searching for the scientists and their experiment. When they tracked down the family, they threatened to tear it apart. The staff abducted Zac's parents and demanded that the couple assist in his capture and return. Seized by the fear of losing his freedom and his parents, Zac unleashed every ounce of his raw energy and mass for the very first time. He subdued his parents' captors, sent the laboratory's workers fleeing, and brought his loved ones home. From then on, Zac vowed to defend all ordinary lives threatened by extraordinary treachery and wickedness. Originally built to destroy, he now protects the innocent and the helpless.\n[[File:Zac quote.png|thumb|center|570px]]\n", "id": 154}, "Talon": {"key": "Talon", "name": "Talon", "title": "the Blade's Shadow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Talon\n|alias = The Blade's Shadow\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Noxian Diplomacy|Talon|Arm Blade}}\n* {{ai|Rake|Talon|Circular Daggers}}\n* {{ai|Shadow Assault|Talon|Double-Edged Blades}}\n|render = Talon Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Assassin\n* &lt;s&gt;Thief&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Katarina\n|rivals = Quinn\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The three deadliest blademasters in all of [[Valoran]] are bound to the house of Du Couteau: my father, myself, and {{ci|Talon}}.

According to them, Swain limped into the ward without cry or complaint: his right leg was snapped in half, with bone protruding from the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain\u2019s measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor\u2019s recommendation of magical treatment for the leg\u2019s inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in documents from the Noxian military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus\u2019 proud legion, but the records indicate his first designation was that of a ranking officer.\n\nThe men who've served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command's hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. A cunning strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the [[Ionia]]n Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion. If Swain was upset by the events which unfolded, he never believed it. His face was so implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something utterly inhuman beneath. More controversy surrounded the bird that never left his shoulder, whose name he whispered only to it.

He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P1.png|thumb|left|150px]]\n\nBorn to the nomadic river-folk of the Serpentine, the boy was taught the magic of the cards at an early age and soon learned what it was to be hated. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange ways, the boy's people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders claimed this was the way of the world, but their refusal to fight back against this prejudice always rankled the young boy's sensibilities.\n\nWhen men who'd lost their fortunes in the gambling tents of the river folk returned in the dead of night to exact vengeance, they came bearing cudgels and emboldened by cheap rotgut. They beat the river folk back to their boats with curses and blows, eventually turning their weapons upon the boy's family. The boy could take no more and fought back, driving the men away with swift blows from their own clubs.\n\nProud of what he had done, the boy was stunned when his people turned their back on him. Retaliation went against the code of the river, and there could be only one punishment. Exile. His whole world falling apart around him, the boy watched helplessly as the barques of his folk sailed away without him, leaving him with nothing, alone for the first time in his life.\n\nThe boy grew to manhood drifting from town to town, trawling the gambling dens of every city he came to, using his preternatural skill at cards to earn coin to survive. That he was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus. Though always careful to let his opponents win at least some hands, he soon learned more ways to fight when many a disgruntled opponent sought to reclaim their lost fortunes.\n\nAcross one table, he met a fellow named Malcolm Graves and, recognizing a kindred soul, joined forces with him. The two spent years cutting a ruinous swathe across Valoran. With every con, swindle, and heist, he sought ever more dangerous means to make the cards bend to his will.\n\nThat search ended badly when a heist went wrong, resulting in Graves being taken alive, though the riverman ran free. The exact circumstances of that night and its dire consequences for both men remain shrouded in mystery, for the gambler never speaks of it. Seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the waters and took another: Twisted Fate.\n\nIn the time since, Twisted Fate has continued to ply his games of chance in the high parlors and low dens of every city he visits, earning countless fortunes along the way \u2013 though none can say what becomes of these winnings (other than his fine clothes) or why he seems driven to amass such wealth. He has been imprisoned with great fanfare on dozens of occasions, but there is no cell in Runeterra that has been able to hold him. Twisted Fate is always gone with morning's light, leaving only a mocking calling card to speak to his being there at all.\n\nIn Bilgewater, Twisted Fate and Graves finally had their day of reckoning. After a highly destructive running battle, and narrowly avoiding death at the hands of {{ci|Gangplank}}, the pair finally put aside their differences, and are now once again working together.\n\nNigh-on impossible to track, Twisted Fate has been said to vanish into thin air every time an enemy believes they have him cornered. A useful skill indeed for a man who has parted thousands of souls from their gold...\n\n''All eyes in Fortune's Glory were on Twisted Fate. He felt the gambling hall's many patrons regarding him with a mixture of envy, vicarious excitement, and spiteful longing for him to lose everything on the turn of the last card. Beyond the avarice common to dens of chance, Twisted Fate felt a singular purpose at work here, a noose being slowly drawn around his neck. The cards were twitching in agitation, warning him of danger. He knew he should fold and get out before whoever was hunting him sprang their trap, but the opportunity to make a pauper of the man across the table was too enticing to forego.''\n\n''He grinned at his opponent, a greedy merchant whose fortune was built on the whipped backs of enslaved miners. The man's robes were expensive: Freljord furs, hand-tooled leather, and Bilgewater sea charms. Every finger boasted a ring of blood gold worth more than most men would see in a lifetime. Aromatic smoke drifted from clay pipes to hang over the fortune in coin, jewelry, and deeds lying between them like a pirate's treasure horde.''\n\n''Twisted Fate nodded toward the merchant.''\n\n''&quot;I do believe it's your call, Master Henmar.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I am aware of the rules, river rat,&quot; said Henmar, as Twisted Fate ran his tattooed fingers in a repeating spiral pattern on the backs of his cards. &quot;And do not think any of your fancy sleight of hand is going to distract me into making an error of judgment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Distract you?&quot; said Twisted Fate, exuding laconic confidence in every gesture. &quot;I declare, I would never stoop to such a low and dishonorable ruse.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No? Then why is it your eyes keep darting from the table?&quot; said Henmar. &quot;Listen closely, I have negotiated with the best of them, and I know the tell of a desperate man when I see it.&quot;''\n\n''Twisted Fate gave a sly grin, swapping the cards between his hands and theatrically doffing his wide-brimmed hat.''\n\n''&quot;You're sharp, sir. I can see that,&quot; he said, sweeping his gaze across the gathered crowd. The usual collection of hangers-on; men and women hoping that whoever won might be generous to those nearby. The cards trembled as Twisted Fate's eyes fell upon certain individuals and he felt his mouth fill with the rancid flavor of sour milk. He'd long learned to trust that reaction as a sign of imminent bedlam.''\n\n''There. A man with an eye patch and a flame-haired woman. They were almost certainly armed and well aware of his slippery nature. Did he know them? Probably not. Were they working for Henmar, protecting his assets? Unlikely. A man like Henmar would make it obvious who he'd brought. Bounty hunters then. The cards were growing ever more alarmed in Twisted Fate's hands. He slipped them together and placed them flat on the table.''\n\n''&quot;You have a look that tells me you know you have already lost,&quot; said Henmar with the tone of a man who believes everyone to be his inferior.''\n\n''&quot;Then what say we make this a little more interesting, sir?&quot; replied Twisted Fate, spreading the cards in a fan and watching as the hunters eased closer. &quot;Care to double down?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Are you able to cover that much?&quot; asked Henmar suspiciously.''\n\n''&quot;Easily,&quot; said Twisted Fate, locking his gaze with the merchant and lifting a heavy pouch of coins from the voluminous pockets of his long coat. &quot;Can you?&quot;''\n\n''Henmar licked his lips and snapped his fingers. A flunky behind the merchant handed him a matching bag of coins. The patrons of Fortune's Glory gave a collective moan as it was added to the gold heaped in the middle of the table. Wars had been waged for less coin than was at stake here.''\n\n''&quot;You first,&quot; said Henmar.''\n\n''&quot;Always,&quot; agreed Twisted Fate, flipping over his cards as the bounty hunters made their move.''\n\n''The man with the eye patch lunged at him with a capture collar. The woman shouted his name and drew a matching pair of pistols.''\n\n''Twisted Fate kicked the underside of the table, spinning it into the air in a shower of coins, cards, and parchment. The pistols fired with deafening roars, blasting fist-sized holes in the table. The capture collar snapped closed, but when the smoke cleared and the screams stopped, Twisted Fate was nowhere to be found.''\n\n''Henmar rose to his feet, his face twisted in outrage as he searched in vain for his opponent. He looked down at the broken pieces of the table and the color drained from his face.''\n\n''&quot;Where is the money?&quot; he yelled. &quot;Where is my money?&quot;''\n\n''Five cards fluttered face-up to the floor of Fortune's Glory.''\n\n''A winning hand.''\n{{clr}}\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n", "id": 4}, "Chogath": {"key": "Chogath", "name": "Cho'Gath", "title": "the Terror of the Void", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Cho'Gath\n|alias = The Terror of the Void\n|render = Cho'Gath Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = *[[Void]]born &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;([[Cyborg]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution|Battlecast]] Member {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]] \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Malzahar \n|friends = Kog'Maw, Kha'Zix, Vel'Koz\n|rivals = \n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast Army]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Woe betides the day when {{ci|Cho'Gath}} grows weary of the League.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere is a place between dimensions, between worlds.

Cho'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name. Its fellows have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into [[Runeterra]], where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world. They are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have been removed from history altogether. It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity.\n\nIf such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will return. Even now, something dark stirs in [[Icathia]], perverting the summoning rituals of [[the League]] to allow the presence of Cho'Gath. It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear. Cho'Gath even appears to {{ai|Feast|Cho'Gath|feed}} on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself. Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a monster could be contained. Fortunately, the power of the League's summoning has confined Cho'Gath's presence exclusively to the League of Legends. It is here that summoners use Cho'Gath's Voidborn abilities to help decide the fate of Runeterra. The Terror of the Void knows what fate it would choose for Runeterra, given half the chance.\n\n", "id": 31}, "Udyr": {"key": "Udyr", "name": "Udyr", "title": "the Spirit Walker", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Udyr\n|alias        = * The Spirit Walker\n|render       = [[File:Udyr_Render.png|link=|250px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = [[Freljord]]\n|residence    = [[Freljord]] &lt;small&gt;(Previously [[Ionia|Hirana Monastery]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Spirit Walker\n* &lt;small&gt;(Guardian of the [[Ionia|Hirana Monastery]]{{w|Alternate history|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord_Winters_Claw.png|15px|link=]] [[Winter's Claw]]\n* [[File:Ionia_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n|friends      = Nidalee, Lee Sin, Sejuani\n|rivals       = Lissandra\n|related      = * [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/ The Freljord]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPIMxSYYne4 Spirit Guard]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\n[[File:Freljord_Udyr.png|thumb|310px]]\n\nUdyr is more than a man; he is a vessel for the untamed power of four primal animal spirits. When tapping into the spirits' bestial natures, Udyr can harness their unique strengths: the tiger grants him speed and ferocity, the turtle resilience, the bear might, and the phoenix its eternal flame. With their combined power, Udyr can turn back all those who would attempt to harm the natural order.\n\nIn the [[Freljord]], there is a unique caste that lives outside the society of those savage lands. They are the custodians of the natural world: the Spirit Walkers. Once a generation, a child is born under a blood red moon, a child said to live between the two worlds of spirit and man. This child is brought to the Spirit Walker to continue the shamanic line. Udyr was such a child, and knew the howl of the tundra wolves even before he learned the language of his ancestors. Through the Spirit Walker, Udyr would one day learn the meaning of the spirits\u0092 calls and tend to the balance of nature. The Spirit Walker often told Udyr he would be tested more than those who had come before him, for the spirits of the Freljord were growing ever more restless, though the reason remained clouded.\n\nThe answer arrived in the dead of winter, as Udyr and the Spirit Walker were descended upon by a fearsome figure known only through frightened whispers: the Ice Witch. Knowing the boy would fall easy prey to her vile magic, the Spirit Walker shielded the child from her assault at the cost of his own life. Wracked by grief, Udyr howled with fury, and he felt the Freljord itself howl with him. In that moment, the child embraced the spirits'\u0092 primal nature and became a beast himself. Coursing with their untamed power, Udyr'\u0092s angry roar shook the mountaintops and brought down a torrential avalanche. Once Udyr had finally clawed his way out of the frost, the {{ci|Lissandra|Ice Witch}} was nowhere to be found.\n\nFor years, the tribes of the north learned to avoid the wildman and his domain. Then one day, Udyr caught the scent of a fearless trespasser. Determined to chase the intruder from his territory, he attacked, only to be deflected with ease. The wildman launched himself at the stranger again and again, only to be effortlessly cast aside each time. Exhausted and defeated, Udyr felt his animosity ebb and croaked a clumsy \u0093&quot;who&quot;\u0094 to the stranger. {{ci|Lee Sin}} had come seeking the Spirit Walker\u0092's guidance and instead found a man who had also lost his way. The monk promised he would right Udyr\u0092's path and guided him to a monastery said to be protected by four eternal spirits of great power and wisdom. There, Udyr would find harmony.\n\nLee Sin brought Udyr to a land that was a stark contrast to his birthplace. Survival was not the only law that governed the lives of Ionians or creatures of the land. For the first time, Udyr felt at peace with the spirits surrounding him and found comfort in human companionship. His time among the monks taught him to temper his instincts, while his meditations with the ancient temple spirits taught him wisdom. Through them both, Udyr learned to truly embrace his life as the next Spirit Walker.\n\nUdyr owed much to the Ionians. It was a debt he was never asked to honor, but one he would ultimately repay many times over. When the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded, Udyr did not stand idle as the brutal soldiers oppressed the peaceful Ionians - he had not forgotten how to bare his teeth. Udyr leapt at their armies with all the ferocity of a cornered beast and gave the invaders good reason to fear the wilderness. From the trees, his claws tore the Noxians down in scores; on the river banks, he threw them back with the falling tides, and in the fields, he consumed them with searing wildfire. Only when the Noxians fled with their tails between their legs did Udyr quell his rage.\n\nPeace returned to Ionia, but still Udyr felt something stirring him from his rest. The spirits of the Freljord called out to him, warning of an unnatural evil emerging from the ice. Udyr understood the true threat that the Ice Witch posed to his homeland: she was the herald of a greater darkness that would soon envelop the land. Armed with the potent spirits of the temple, Udyr returned to the Freljord, seeking to defend the natural world from all who would threaten its balance.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Through us, nature's will is done.&quot;|'''Udyr'''}}\n\n", "id": 77}, "Lucian": {"key": "Lucian", "name": "Lucian", "title": "the Purifier", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lucian\n|alias = The Purifier\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Lightslinger|Lucian|Light Pistol}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Lightslinger|Lucian|(L-20 Lightcaster}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Lightslinger|Lucian|Senna's Light Pistol}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Lightslinger|Lucian|(S-10 Lightcaster}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Lucian Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=39665132#post39665132 Lucian and Demacia]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Undead Hunter \n* &lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiate {{w|Alternative future|* }})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|enemies = Thresh\n|related = \n* [[Shadow and Fortune]]\n* [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Be grateful.

This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover.\n\nBorn the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, as she was single-handedly defeating crime in Piltover and had developed into a ravishing beauty as well. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by [[Demacia]] to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.\n\nThe bandit, who always left a card with an ornate {{sbc|'C'}} at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across [[Valoran]]. As she travels, she seeks to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track down the only quarry that has managed to evade her.\n\n", "id": 51}, "Anivia": {"key": "Anivia", "name": "Anivia", "title": "the Cryophoenix", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Anivia\n|alias = The Cryophoenix\n|render = Anivia Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Cryophoenix\n|birthplace = [[Freljord]]\n|residence = [[Ironspike Mountains]], [[Freljord]]\n|occupation = \n* Guardian of the [[Freljord]] &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Eventually Corrupted {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]]\n* [[File:Freljord_Avarosan.png|15px|link=]] [[Avarosan]]\n|allies = Tryndamere, Gragas, Braum\n|friends = Ashe, Nunu\n|rivals = Brand, Lissandra\n|related = [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/ The Freljord]\n}}\n\n", "background": "[File:Freljord Anivia.png|center|400px]]\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;I am the fury of the blizzard, the bite of the wind, and the cold of the ice.

A benevolent but mysterious creature, Anivia is eternally bound to keep vigil over the Freljord through life, death, and {{ai|Rebirth|Anivia|rebirth}}.\n\nAnivia is as much a part of the Freljord as the never-ending frost. Long before mortals had ever set foot on the land's frigid tundra, she had lived countless lifetimes and died as many deaths. The beginnings and ends of her eternal cycle always heralded great change, from the calming of raging storms to the ebb and flow of ice ages. It is said that when the cryophoenix dies, an era ends; and when she is reborn, a new era begins.\n\nThough Anivia's past lifetimes have faded from her memory, she knows her purpose: she must protect the Freljord at all costs.\n\nWhen she was last reborn, Anivia witnessed the rise of a mighty and united human tribe. She guarded their lands with pride as they prospered, but such unity could not last forever. The great tribe fractured into three, and after that upheaval, Anivia watched the people of the Freljord become embroiled in battle. As she strove to calm the turmoil tearing her home apart, Anivia began to sense a greater threat: {{ci|Lissandra|an ancient evil}} growing deep within the earth. To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt. Like blood in water, darkness crept into the Freljord. With her destiny so tied to the power of the land, Anivia knew if such evil took root in her home, that same darkness would find its way into {{csl|Anivia|Blackfrost|her heart}}. She could no longer remain a mere guardian - the cryophoenix had to act.\n\nAnivia soon discovered an ally in {{ci|Ashe}}, the Frost Archer. Ashe too believed in unification as an end to the Freljord's perpetual strife, and Anivia offered the tribal leader her aid. Now, with war on the horizon, Anivia prepares to fight for peace, but she knows the inevitable truth of her destiny.

This belief was put to the test when a rash of sleep-related incidents started afflicting [[summoner]]s of the [[the League of Legends|League]]. Some would wake up screaming, terrified and beyond consolation. Some could not fall asleep, slowly going mad as the nights ticked by. Some simply never woke up. Physicians were baffled until a [[Field of Justice|Field]] Architect happened to pass out next to a [[nexus]] on the [[Twisted Treeline]]. Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after, magical energy arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.\n\nNocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered everything he could find before summoners were able to magically confine him. After a period of intense study, League experts divined that Nocturne hunted summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was useless. This seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded justice, but League officials were concerned that death might only return Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus fragment, trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed summoners to call upon Nocturne in League matches, bending his will to the summoners he hates and creating his own personal nightmare. League scholars don\u2019t know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether there are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected the summoners' subconscious minds, luring Nocturne to them in their sleep.

Being obsessed with time, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city's Clock Tower. As the havoc of the war neared his home, '''Zilean''' experimented with powerful temporal magic to divine all possible futures, hoping to discover a peaceful solution. But '''Zilean's''' enchantments affected his perception of the passage of time, and he was in a contemplative stasis when Urtistan was set upon by an entire phalanx of dark summoner-knights of unknown affiliation.

As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite his genuinely warm personality, something switches off inside Teemo's mind during combat so that the lives he must end while on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo's superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership, which is one of Bandle City's most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling Commandos.\n\nWhile most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of the most dangerous yordles alive, though you'd never know it by having a cup of honey mead with him at his favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first [[champion]] for [[the League]], and he has taken to it like a duck to water. His signature weapon - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles of [[Kumungu]]. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently struck up a friendship with {{ci|Tristana}}, a fellow League champion and fellow member of Bandle City's Special Forces. This connection is healthy for both yordles, though now [[Valoran|Valoran's]] voracious media outlets circulate rumors that the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship.

Their 'zero tolerance' moral code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike. In combat, this means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender by example. Garen, the valiant warrior who bears the title 'the Might of Demacia', is the paradigm to which these leaders are compared. Thousands of great heroes have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its preeminent rival, [[Noxus]]. It was beneath their mighty banners of war that Garen first met steel with {{ci|Katarina}}, the Sinister Blade. The infantrymen who beheld this event (and survived) commented that it seemed as though the two were locked in a mortal waltz set against a symphony of clashing blades.\n\nGaren, the pride of the Demacian military and the leader of the Dauntless Vanguard, returned from this battle breathless for the first time in his career, though some speculate this was due to reasons other than exhaustion. The plausibility of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again. A paragon of Demacian ethic, Garen never entertained such allegations, for he knew others couldn't understand. Even simply the pursuit of a worthy opponent on the battlefield is, to a true warrior, the reason to rise each morning. The promise of one, particularly one so beautifully and diametrically opposed, is the validation of his existence.\n\n", "id": 86}, "Blitzcrank": {"key": "Blitzcrank", "name": "Blitzcrank", "title": "the Great Steam Golem", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Blitzcrank\n|alias = The Great Steam Golem \n|render = Blitzcrank Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Steam Golem &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Techmaturgical Construct)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Piltover Policeman {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Rammus, Orianna, Viktor\n|rivals = \n|related = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Though {{ci|Blitzcrank}} may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has a heart of gold... encased in a framework of iron... in a carapace of steel.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\n[[Zaun]] is a place where both magic and science have gone awry, and the unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city. However, Zaun's lenient restrictions allow their researchers and inventors the leeway to push the bounds of science at an accelerated rate, for better or worse. \n\nIt was under these conditions that a team of {{ci|Viktor|doctoral students}} from Zaun's College of Techmaturgy made a breakthrough in the field of intelligent steam automation. Their creation, the steam golem Blitzcrank, was developed to exercise judgement on-the-fly in order to assist with Zaun's hazardous waste reclamation process, since so often the conditions did not allow for human supervision. However, he soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\nOver time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity. As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem's creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth. In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.\n\nBacked by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity. A unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in. Now he searches the lands of [[Valoran]] to find a place he might someday belong.\n\n", "id": 53}, "MasterYi": {"key": "MasterYi", "name": "Master Yi", "title": "the Wuju Bladesman", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Master Yi\n|alias = \n* The Wuju Bladesman\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Highlander|Master Yi|'Highlander' Ring Sword}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Highlander|Master Yi|(Hyperlight 'Alpha' Blade}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi}}\n* {{ai|Meditate|Master Yi|Seven Lenses of Insight}}\n|render = Master Yi Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Wuju Practitioner\n* Wuju Teacher\n* &lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiate {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Wukong\n|enemies = Singed\n|related = [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The edge of {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|the sharpest blade}} is no match for the calm of {{ai|Meditate|Master Yi|the peaceful mind}}.&quot;'' - {{ci|Master Yi}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThrough the ancient martial art of {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|Wuju}}, Master Yi tempered his body and sharpened his mind until thought and action became one. Though he chooses to enter into violence as a last resort, the {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|grace}} and {{ai|Double Strike|Master Yi|speed}} with which he wields {{ai|Highlander|Master Yi|his blade}} ensures resolution is always swift. As the last living practitioner of Wuju, Master Yi has devoted his life to finding able pupils to carry on the legacy of his lost people.\n\nEven before Yi mastered Wuju, he was considered one of the most skilled practitioners of the mystical martial art. He would soon prove his mastery when word of a massive [[Noxus|Noxian]] invasion reached his remote village. Yi swept across the battlefields of [[Ionia]], turning back the tide of Noxus' vast infantry with {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|swift}} and {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|deadly}} strikes, much to the embarrassment of the Noxian High Command.\n\nRecognizing the threat the Wuju disciples posed to their invasion, the Noxians chose to unleash a nightmarish {{ci|Singed|chemical attack}} on the home of the deadly art. Those who somehow survived the poisonous concoction had their minds twisted beyond repair. Yi's home was left in ruin.\n\nAt the war's conclusion, Yi returned to the grotesque remains of his village. There he became the attack's final casualty. Slain in spirit, if not in body, Yi clung to the only feeling left within his heart: vengeance. Driven only by his desire to punish those who'd destroyed his home, Yi spent years training in seclusion.\n\nHe became a deadlier swordsman than he had ever been, but true mastery of Wuju still eluded him. At the height of Yi's frustration, {{ci|Wukong|a monkey}} of unusually noble bearing interrupted his training.\n\nStanding as straight and tall as a man, the monkey watched and mimicked Yi's movements. Yi shooed the monkey away, but the agile creature took great amusement in turning Yi's own techniques against him.\n\nGradually, Yi felt his anger subside as he sparred with the playful animal, and when the burden of his hatred had fully lifted, he found he had caught the monkey by his tail. Yi then understood that he would never master Wuju so long as he pursued it for vengeance, and as he let go of the monkey, he also released his desire to shed his enemy's blood.\n\nYi thanked the monkey for showing him what he'd been blind to, and was surprised when the creature actually replied. He wished to learn Yi's art of fighting.\n\nIt was an odd request, but through it Yi saw his new path: the way to honor the memory of his lost people was to pass their teachings on to a new generation.\n\n", "id": 11}, "Elise": {"key": "Elise", "name": "Elise", "title": "the Spider Queen", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Elise\n|real_name = Elise Kythera Zaavan\n|alias = \n* The Spider Queen\n* &lt;s&gt;Lady Elise&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|Spiderlings}}\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|render = Elise Render.png\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Shapeshifter)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Immortal Bastion, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* House Zaavan Mistress\n* Artifact Collector\n* {{moi|Vilemaw}}'s High Priestess and Feeder &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36346739#36346739 kitae on Vilemaw]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] [[The Black Rose]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Vilemaw\n|friends = LeBlanc, Vladimir\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/elise?_k=h7d851 Spider Queen]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Beauty is power too, and can strike swifter than any sword.&quot;'' - {{ci|Elise}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nElise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep in the Immortal Bastion of [[Noxus]].

Alistar was lured from his village by the machinations of Keiran Darkwill, General Boram Darkwill's youngest son, and commander of the Noxian expeditionary force. When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus's elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds. Only the intervention of some of Noxus's most skilled summoners checked Alistar's rage. Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment of Noxus's wealthy leaders.\n\nAlistar's once noble soul slowly became twisted, and he would have been driven to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and eventually arranged for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]] to fight as a [[champion]], hoping to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially unwilling to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since discovered that there is power in fame, and he has become a vocal advocate for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden\u2014something that has made him very unpopular with Noxus's nobles.

As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general, many paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade.\n\nRigorously trained by the finest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking [[Demacia]]n officer.\n\nAs she set to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night.\n\nKatarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nFurious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task. Returning to the camp, she spied her now heavily guarded target and realized a stealthy kill was no longer possible. Drawing {{ai|Bouncing Blades|Katarina|her blades}}, Katarina swore the officer would die, no matter the cost.\n\nShe {{ai|Shunpo|Katarina|leapt}} into battle, unleashing {{ai|Death Lotus|Katarina|a whirlwind of steel}}. One by one blades flashed and guards fell, each strike bringing her one step closer to the officer.

It wasn't that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn't compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked.\n\nThis was how she found {{ai|Pix, Faerie Companion|Lulu|Pix}}, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu's imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to [[the Glade]], the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods.\n\nThere the rigid properties of the outside world - things like {{ai|Wild Growth|Lulu|size}} and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place. She quickly lost track of time.\n\nHer life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were 'only pretend', and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal.\n\nLulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she'd learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away.\n\nLulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily {{ai|Whimsy|Lulu|changing}} them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn't appreciate her efforts.\n\nWhen the [[yordle]]s insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.\n\n", "id": 117}, "Aatrox": {"key": "Aatrox", "name": "Aatrox", "title": "the Darkin Blade", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Aatrox\n|alias = The Darkin Blade\n|render = Aatrox Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[Darkin]]\n|birthplace = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Ancient Times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = Avatar of War\n|faction = \n* Independent\n|allies = \n|friends = Tahm Kench\n|rivals = Tryndamere\n|related = [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Some fight for honor, some fight for glory.

He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\n\nThe earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Protectorate and the [[File:ProfileIcon713 Red Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Magelords. Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped. They braced for inevitable defeat.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words, he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. His presence inspired the desperate warriors. At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies, his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon, the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.\n\n[[File:Aatrox Statuesketch.png|left|180px]]\n\nAatrox vanished after that battle, but the Protectorate army's newfound fury did not. Their surprising triumph led to many more until they were able to finally return home victorious. Their countrymen hailed them as heroes, but though they had saved their entire civilization from destruction, darkness lingered in the mind of each warrior. Something within them had changed. Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.\n\nTales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\n\n", "id": 266}, "Draven": {"key": "Draven", "name": "Draven", "title": "the Glorious Executioner", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Draven\n|alias = \n* The Glorious Executioner\n* Draaaaven\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven|Spinning Axes}}\n|render = Draven Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Executioner\n* &lt;small&gt;(News Reporter {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = Draven\n|friends = Darius, Draven\n|rivals = Darius\n|related = \n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;The 'best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.&quot;'' - {{ci|Draven}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nUnlike his brother {{ci|Darius}}, victory in battle was never enough for Draven.

There he carved out the celebrity he desired by turning the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle.

At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of [[the League]]'s first [[summoner]]s. Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.\n\nWhat exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in [[Summoner's Rift]]. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were {{ai|Terrify|Fiddlesticks|driven mad by fear}}, mere husks of men gibbering about {{ai|Crowstorm|Fiddlesticks|crows}} and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy. Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the [[Fields of Justice]], what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown.

He was born among the Rakkor, a warlike people living on the flanks of Mount Targon, and after climbing the mountain's treacherous peak and being deemed worthy, he was chosen to become the earthly incarnation of the celestial Aspect of War. Imbued with inhuman power, he relentlessly seeks the enemies of Targon, leaving only corpses in his wake.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nAtreus was a proud young Rakkoran named after one of the four stars that formed the Warrior constellation in the night sky \u2013 the constellation known to the Rakkor as the Pantheon. While not the fastest or strongest of the young warriors of Mount Targon, nor the most skilled with the bow, spear or blade, Atreus was determined, single-minded, and his endurance was legendary among his peers. Every day before dawn, while the others slept, he rose to run the treacherous paths of Mount Targon, and he was ever the last to leave the training ground at night, his arms leaden from blade-work. \n\nA fierce rivalry developed between Atreus and another young Rakkoran, a boy called Pylas. Born into a line of renowned warriors, Pylas was skillful, strong, and popular. He seemed destined for greatness, and none his age could best him in the fighting circle. Only Atreus refused to back down, pushing himself up from the ground to fight on, bloodied and bruised, even after being knocked down again and again. While this earned Atreus the respect of his grizzled instructors, it gained him the enmity of Pylas, who took Atreus\u2019s unrelenting defiance as a lack of respect. \nAtreus was shunned by his peers and suffered numerous beatings from Pylas and his followers, though he endured it all with stoic resilience. He kept his growing ostracism a secret from his family, knowing it would only cause them pain. \nOn an early winter patrol, a day\u2019s march from their village, the young warriors and their trainers came upon the smoking ruin of a Rakkoran outpost. Blood stained the snow, and bodies lay strewn across the ground. A hasty retreat was ordered, but it was too late\u2026 the enemy was already upon them. \n\nClad in furs and heavy iron armor, the outsiders sprang from beneath the snow, axes flashing in the cold light. None of the young warriors had completed their training, and their superiors were all greybeards, well past their prime, yet several enemies were slain for every one of their own that fell. Nevertheless, the outsiders outnumbered them, and the Rakkor were cut down, one by one. \n\nPylas and Atreus fought back to back, the last of the Rakkor still standing. Both were injured and bleeding. The battle would be over in moments, yet they knew they had to warn the village. Atreus plunged his spear into a barbarian\u2019s throat, while Pylas cut down two more, creating a momentary gap in the circle of enemies. Atreus told Pylas to go, saying that he would hold their enemies off so Pylas could get away. With no time to argue \u2013 Atreus was already charging the enemy \u2013 Pylas ran. \n\nAtreus fought hard, but as a heavy axe slammed into his chest, he finally fell, and slipped into unconsciousness. \nAtreus awoke, not in the celestial afterlife as he had expected, but upon the mountain where he had fallen. The sun had dropped behind the surrounding peaks, and a fresh layer of snow covered him. Numb and barely lucid, he pushed himself to his feet. He picked his way between the bodies of the fallen Rakkor, but all were dead. Worse, Pylas lay some way off, a throwing axe embedded in his back. Word had not reached their village. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-stumbling to Pylas\u2019s side, Atreus found his one-time rival alive, but horribly wounded. Hefting the young warrior to his shoulders, Atreus began the long trek home. Three days later, he stumbled to the outskirts of their village, and finally allowed himself to collapse. \n\nHe awoke to find Pylas watching over him, and his wounds stitched and bound. While Atreus was relieved to find that their village had not been attacked, he was also surprised to learn that neither the Rakkor nor the Solari elders had sent out the Ra-Horak to find and kill the intruders, choosing instead to stay and defend against any possible attack. \n\nIn the months that followed, Atreus and Pylas became close friends. All earlier antagonism forgotten, they threw themselves into their training with renewed vigor and purpose. All the while, Atreus\u2019s resentment toward the Solari order grew. He felt the best way to protect the Rakkor was to actively seek out and destroy their would-be enemies, but the new leader of the Solari\u2019s warriors \u2013 a former member of his own tribe, Leona \u2013 preached a different form of protection, which Atreus felt was weak and passive. \n\nAs with all young Rakkorans, Atreus and Pylas had grown up hearing stories of great heroes climbing to the peak of Mount Targon and being blessed with great power. Having passed the arduous Rakkoran warrior rites together, the pair began to train in earnest toward making the ascent themselves. Atreus hoped to gain the power he would need to seek out and defeat the enemies of the Rakkor himself, since it seemed the Solari were not willing to do so. \nOnly the strongest attempted the climb, and fewer than one in a thousand even glimpsed the peak. Nevertheless, Atreus and Pylas joined a larger group gathered from all the Rakkoran villages scattered around the foothills of the mountain, and began the ascent. As they set off, the sun turned dark as the silver moon passed before it. Some saw this as an ill omen, but Atreus took it as a sign he was on the right path \u2013 that his beliefs about the Solari were correct.\n \nAfter weeks of climbing, the group was half its original size. Some had turned back, while others had been claimed by the mountain, having fallen into crevasses, been buried beneath avalanches, or frozen to death in the night. They were high above the cloud line, and the sky was filled with strange shifting lights and illusions. Still they pressed on. \n\nThe air grew steadily thinner, and the cold ever more bitter as the weeks turned to months. Several climbers stopped to catch their breath, never to move again, their flesh freezing to the mountain. Others, driven insane by the lack of air and exhaustion, threw themselves from the cliffs, falling like stones. One by one, the mountain claimed those who attempted to master it, until only Pylas and Atreus remained. \n\nExhausted, frozen, and their minds addled, the pair made the final ascent to the summit, only to find\u2026 nothing. \nThey saw no fabled city at the peak, nor any sky-warrior heroes waiting to embrace them \u2013 only ice, death, and rocks twisted into strange circular shapes. Pylas collapsed, the last of his strength finally giving out, and Atreus roared his frustration. \n\nKnowing Pylas had not the strength to make the descent, Atreus sat with him, cradling his head in his lap as he watched the life drain from his friend. \n\nThen the heavens opened. The air shimmered like liquid, and a gateway opened before Atreus. Golden light spilled out, warming his face, and a city beyond the veil could be glimpsed \u2013 a place of inconceivable architecture and grandiose vision. A figure stood waiting for him, hand outstretched. \n\nTears of awe ran down Atreus\u2019s face. He would not have left his friend, but as he looked down he saw that Pylas had died in his arms, a beatific smile upon his face. Atreus stood, closed his friend\u2019s eyes, and laid him gently on the melting snow. He stepped forward to meet his guide, walking through the veil of reality to the real Targon. \nMonths passed. On the lower flanks of the mountain, it was assumed Atreus and Pylas had died along with everyone else who had attempted the ascent. They were mourned, but this was nothing unusual, nor was it unexpected. Only once in a generation did someone return with power from the top of the mountain. \n\nIt was at this time that another raiding party of northern barbarians mysteriously appeared on the mountain, almost a year to the day since they had butchered those Rakkorans at the outpost and Atreus\u2019s peers. They attacked a number of isolated villages, slaughtering and pillaging, before pushing on toward a Solari shrine high upon the mountain. The guards there were heavily outnumbered, yet they stood ready to die defending the relics and mystics within. \nAs the enemy marauders closed in, an unnatural, keening wind descended, whipping the snow around in a growing fury. The swirling clouds parted, exposing the full majesty of Mount Targon at the epicenter of the storm. Warriors on both sides struggled to maintain their footing, shielding their eyes against the ice storm as a ghostly, glowing city appeared in the heavens at the mountain\u2019s apex. \n\nThe four stars of the Pantheon constellation pulsed brightly, then turned dark overhead. Simultaneously, the burning light of a falling star appeared within the ethereal city and streaked toward the ground. \n\nIt screamed toward the temple, moving at astonishing speed, and the barbarians prayed to their heathen gods in quivering voices. The streaming light slammed down, striking the ground between the two forces with an earth-shattering impact. \n\nThis was no star, but a warrior mantled in starlight and bearing a gleaming, golden shield and spear of legend. He had landed in a warrior\u2019s crouch, one knee lowered to the ground, and as he looked up at the enemy defiling the lands of Mount Targon, the Rakkorans saw it was Atreus\u2026 and yet not Atreus. The Aspect of the Warrior had infused him, and he was now both mortal and immortal, the incarnation of war made flesh. He was now an avatar of battle.

His enemies defeated, Pantheon marched into the roaring ice storm and disappeared. \n\nAtreus\u2019s family mourned their son and held a funeral for him. While they had suspected he was dead after he had not returned from the expedition, now his demise was confirmed. The Pantheon Aspect had obliterated his personality, memories and emotions.

They are not immortal, limited by the human flesh they inhabit, and can be killed, though it takes great effort to do so. Pantheon\u2019s latest appearance has been greatly debated by the elders of the Solari, for his arrival is both a blessing and a curse, as it often heralds a time of darkness yet to come... \n\n", "id": 80}, "XinZhao": {"key": "XinZhao", "name": "Xin Zhao", "title": "the Seneschal of Demacia", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Xin Zhao\n|alias        = * The Seneschal of Demacia\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nXin_Zhao_Render.png|Current\nXin Zhao Viscero Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown\n|residence    = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation   = * Steward of the Lightshield Dynasty\n* &lt;s&gt;Gladiator&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Demacia_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Garen, Sona, Alistar\n|rivals       = \n|related      = \n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\n\n''&quot;Death is inevitable; one can only avoid defeat.&quot;''\n\nWhenever Jarvan III, the king of [[Demacia]], delivers one of his rallying speeches from the glinting marble balcony atop the Royal Palace, Xin Zhao is at his side. Coined the Seneschal of Demacia, Xin Zhao is the personal steward of the Lightshield Dynasty. His enigmatic, silent vigil has led to an abundance of conjecture concerning his \u201csecret life\u201d and origins. Whether it\u2019s &quot;[[Zaun]] double-agent&quot; tendered at the dinner table or &quot;indebted rune mage&quot; mused in the editorials of the Demacian Constant, Xin Zhao betrays no hints to sate the curiosity of the masses\u2026for good reason.\n\nYears ago, [[Noxus]] was renowned for a spectacle called The Fleshing. It was a gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter won matches, his number of opponents (generally prisoners of war) fought simultaneously would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match. \n\nJarvan II, hearing of this unprecedented feat, infiltrated the arena to offer him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately sentenced him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that a king would risk his own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin Zhao and his 300 opponents. During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This act of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot at his side until the day the king died. \n\nNow in the service of his son, Jarvan III, Xin Zhao continues to fight for his adopted country and to honor the legacy of the man who gave purpose to his life.\n\n", "id": 5}, "AurelionSol": {"key": "AurelionSol", "name": "Aurelion Sol", "title": "The Star Forger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Aurelion Sol\n|real_name = \n|alias = The Star Forger \n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Center of the Universe|Aurelion Sol|Cosmic Energy}}\n|render = Aurelion Sol Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Dragon)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Dawn of Time)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Star Forger\n* Cosmic Overlord\n* Servant of the Aspects\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = \n|enemies = Pantheon\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAAnY_L4Pp4 Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/aurelion-sol.html Star Forger]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Cower.

When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.\n\nBeyond it lain the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods.

Before its light fades, the Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and carry it to the surface. There, on the night of the winter solstice of the hundredth year, the Tidecaller makes a ceremonial exchange with a landwalker bearing a moonstone. By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.\n\nHowever, in Nami's time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller had been found. Without a chosen one to complete the quest, her people would face disaster, but the Marai waited in faith that the Tidecaller would appear. Nami refused to sit idle, insisting that without a Tidecaller to save them, someone had to act. Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured alone into the dangerous depths where she had defeated the Kraken and survived an incident of being eaten by the Megalodon. None expected her to survive, but after six days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand. The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.\n\nWhen Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore. She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive. Nami faced a choice. She knew the surface world only through tale and rumor, but the survival of the Marai depended upon her. Summoning the tide to {{ai|Surging Tides|Nami|bear her ashore}}, Nami began her search for the moonstone and became the first of her kind to explore the world above the ocean. She left her home behind, and vowed not to return until she had completed the Tidecaller's quest. She was then gifted extraordinary power and could control waters at her own leisure and began her journey into a new world.  \n\n", "id": 267}, "Jhin": {"key": "Jhin", "name": "Jhin", "title": "the Virtuoso", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jhin\n|real_name = Khada Jhin &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Ionia]]n: 'golden excellence') &lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/WUwqmxEZ-new-champion-qa-jhin-the-virtuoso?show=flat&amp;comment=0015000000000000 Jhin Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|alias = \n* The Virtuoso\n* Artisan Killer\n* Golden Demon\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Whisper|Jhin}}\n* {{ai|Dancing Grenade|Jhin}}\n* {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|Lotus Trap}}\n|render =  Jhin Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Artist\n* Assassin\n* Serial Killer\n* &lt;s&gt;Theatrical Stagehand&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Sona, Master Yi\n|enemies = Shen, Zed\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-BgDEy2AE Mind of the Virtuoso]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-bio-jhin-virtuoso Virtuoso]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;center&gt;''&quot;Art requires a certain... cruelty.&quot;'' - {{ci|Jhin}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nI=\nJhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.\n\nFor years, Ionia's southern mountains were plagued by the infamous &quot;Golden Demon&quot;. Throughout the province of Zhyun, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roads - but nothing slowed the beast's grisly work.\n\nIn desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho for help. Upon hearing of the region's plight, Kusho feigned an excuse for why he couldn't help. But a week later the master, his son {{ci|Shen}}, and star apprentice {{ci|Zed}} disguised themselves as merchants and moved to the province. In secret, they visited the countless families emotionally shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for possible connections or patterns to the murders.\n\nTheir investigation took four long years, and left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho's temple, began to struggle with his studies. Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: ''&quot;Good and evil are not truths. They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.&quot;''\n\nDepicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the capture of the &quot;Golden Demon&quot; would be the seventh and final great feat in the illustrious career of Lord Kusho. On the eve of the Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Everyone had assumed only an evil spirit could commit these horrifying crimes, but Kusho had realized the killer was an ordinary man. The famed &quot;Golden Demon&quot; was actually a mere stagehand in Zhyun's traveling theaters and opera houses working under the name {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}}.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 1.png|center]]\n\nWhen they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. Despite the horrors of Jhin's actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and left at Tuula Prison. Shen disagreed, but accepted the emotionless logic of his father's judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.\n\nThough imprisoned in Tuula for many years, the polite and shy Khada Jhin revealed little of himself - even his real name remained a mystery. But while a prisoner, the monks noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, the guards and monks could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 3.png|center]]\n\nOutside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire's invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation's appetite for bloodshed. The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror.\n\nNow with access to the Kashuri armories' new weapons, and nearly unlimited funds, the scale of Khada Jhin's &quot;performances&quot; has grown. His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia's secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 2.png|center]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|II=\n{{ai|Whisper|Jhin|The gun in his hand}} was simply a tool - but a perfectly crafted one. Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: This detail spoke of its creator's pride and confidence. It was not a Piltovian weapon - those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.\n\nHe wiped the gun's stock a fourth time. He couldn't be sure it was clean until he wiped it down four times. Didn't matter that he hadn't used it. Didn't matter that he was only going to stow it in the bag under the bed. He couldn't put it away until he was sure it was clean. And he couldn't be sure it was clean until he had wiped it down four times. It was getting clean though. Four times makes it clean.\n\nIt was clean, and it was wonderful. His new patrons had been generous. But did the finest painters not deserve the finest brushes?\n\nThe scale and precision of the new device made his previous work with blades seem insignificant by comparison. Understanding firearm mechanics had taken him weeks of study, but evolving his chi techniques from blades had taken months.\n\nThe gun held four shots. Each bullet had been infused with magical energy. Each bullet was as perfect as a Lassilan monk's blade. Each bullet was the paint from which his art would flow. Each bullet was a masterpiece. It didn't just cut apart the body. It rearranged it.\n\nThe rehearsal at the mill town had already shown the gun's potential. And his new employers had been pleased with the work's reception.\n\nHe had finished polishing it, but with the gun in his right hand, the temptation was too great. He knew he shouldn't, but he unpacked the black, eel-skin bodysuit. He drew the fingertips of his left hand across the slick surface of the clothes. The feel of the skin's oily surface quickened his breath. He picked up the tight, leather mask, then - unable to help himself - slid it over his face. It covered his right eye and mouth. It constricted his breathing and removed his depth perception...\n\nDelightful.\n\nHe was putting on the shoulder armor when the bells he'd hidden on the steps leading up to his room sounded. He quickly folded up the weapon and removed the mask.\n\n''&quot;Hello?&quot;'' the maid asked through the door. The lilt in her voice hinted to an upbringing far south of this town.\n\n''&quot;You did what I asked?&quot;'' he said.\n\n''&quot;Yes, sir. A white lantern every four yards. A red lantern every sixteen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I can begin&quot;'', {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}} said as he swung open the door to his room.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened as he exited his room. Jhin was well aware of how he looked. Normally, it elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing, but today was a performance day.\n\nToday, Khada Jhin cut a slender, elegant figure as he walked out with {{ai|Deadly Flourish|Jhin|a cane}}. He was hunched, and his cloak seemed to cover some huge deformity on his shoulder, but a jaunty stride belied this. He forcefully tapped the cane ahead of him as he marched toward the window. He tapped the frame rhythmically - three beats, then a fourth. His gold sparkled, his cream cloak flowed, and his jewels glittered in the sun.\n\n''&quot;What... what is that?&quot;'' the maid asked, indicating Jhin's shoulder.\n\nJhin paused for a moment to study the woman's cherubic face. It was round and perfectly symmetrical. A dull and predictable design. Removed, it would make a terrible mask.\n\n''&quot;It's for {{ai|Curtain Call|Jhin|the crescendo}}, my darling&quot;'', Khada Jhin said.\n\nFrom the inn's window, he had a clear view of the rest of the town in the valley below him. This performance had to be wonderful, but there was still so much work to do. The councilman would be returning this evening - and so far, all of Jhin's plans for tonight seemed... uninspired.\n\n''&quot;I brought some flowers for your room&quot;'', the woman said, walking past him.\n\nHe could have used someone else to place the lanterns. But he didn't. He could have changed clothes before opening his door. But he didn't. Now she had seen Khada Jhin in his finery.\n\nThe inspiration he needed was so obvious now. So preordained. There was never a choice. There was no escaping the Art.\n\nHe would have to make this maid's face... more interesting.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|III=\nThe candied pork glistened on top of the five-flavor broth. The aroma entranced {{ci|Shen}}, but he set aside his spoon. As the waitress left, she smiled and nodded in approval. The fat had yet to melt into the broth. Doubtless, the soup was already excellent, but in a moment, the flavor would be at its peak. Patience.\n\nShen considered the interior of the White Cliffs Inn. It was deceptively simple and rough. The wood weavers had been masters, removing the tree bark and living leaves only where necessary.\n\nThe candle on Shen's table flickered... wrongly. He slid away from the table, retrieving his blades from under his cloak.\n\n''&quot;Your students are as quiet as a pregnant worax&quot;'', Shen said.\n\nAlone and dressed like a merchant, {{ci|Zed}} entered the inn. Brushing past the waitress, he sat down three tables from Shen. Every part of him wanted to {{ai|Shadow Dash|Shen|dash at his foe}}. To avenge his father. But such was not the way of twilight. He calmed himself as he realized the distance was too far... but only by the length of Shen's index finger.\n\nShen looked over at Zed, expecting to see him grin. Instead, his rival sighed. His skin was sallow, and dark folds hung beneath his eyes.\n\n''&quot;Five years, I have waited&quot;'', Shen said.\n\n''&quot;Have I misjudged the distance?&quot;'' Zed asked wearily.\n\n''&quot;Even if my head is cut off, I will still close and strike&quot;'', Shen said, sliding his foot backward and cocking it against the floor. Zed was ten paces and one half of a finger length away.\n\n''&quot;Your path's closer to mine. Your father's ideals were a weakness. Ionia could no longer afford them&quot;'', Zed said. He leaned back in his chair, keeping himself just outside of the range Shen would need to strike a killing blow. ''&quot;I know that's not something I can make you understand. But I will offer you a chance for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not act because of vengeance. You defy the balance. For that, you are damned&quot;'', Shen said as he inched forward to the edge of his chair.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Jhin|The Golden Demon}} escaped&quot;'', Zed replied.\n\n''&quot;Impossible.&quot;'' But Shen felt a hollowness had caught in his chest.\n\n''&quot;Your father's greatest victory. And now, again, his foolish mercy has tarnished his legacy.&quot;'' Zed shook his head. ''&quot;You know what that... thing is capable of.&quot;'' Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. ''&quot;And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him.&quot;''\n\nShen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.\n\nNow, that monster had returned.\n\nShen put his swords on the table. He looked down at the perfect bowl of soup in front of him. Little droplets of the pork fat's oil shimmered on its surface, but he wasn't hungry anymore.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|IV=\nThere was still no sign of {{ci|Zed}}. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. {{ci|Jhin}} needed to be careful.\n\nFrom the jetty, Jhin looked back to the foreign ship. The tide had come in, and the ship would be leaving in a few moments. He would have to return soon if he was going to perform in Zaun next month. Risk on top of risk.\n\nHe stopped to check his reflection in a puddle. From the water, a worried, elderly merchant stared back at him. Years of acting practice combined with his martial training had given him total control of his facial muscles. It was a common face, and he had given it an unexceptional expression. When he walked up the hill, Jhin blended easily into the crowd.\n\nHe checked the white lanterns above him, counting the distance. If Zed appeared, he would need them. At the inn on the top of the hill, he glanced at the planters where he had hidden {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|traps}}. Sharpened steel blades, shaped like flowers. They protected his escape route in case anything went wrong.\n\nHe thought of how the metal would slice through the crowd and splash the building's freshly painted teal walls with red. It was tempting.\n\nHe was pushing through the crowd when he heard the village elder speaking to {{ci|Shen}}.\n\n''&quot;Why would the demon attack her and the councilmen?&quot;'' the elder asked.\n\nShen, dressed in his blue outfit, didn't answer.\n\nAnother kinkou, a young woman named {{ci|Akali}}, stood beside Shen. She walked to the doorway of the inn.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', Shen said as he blocked her path.\n\n''&quot;What makes you think I'm not ready?&quot;'' Akali asked, annoyed.\n\n''&quot;Because I wasn't when I was your age.&quot;''\n\nAt that moment, a town guard stumbled from the entrance, his face pale and hollow.\n\n''&quot;Her flesh, it was... it was...&quot;'' he said. He took a few steps, then collapsed to the ground in shock.\n\n''&quot;He saw it. He saw the flower!&quot;'' Against the far wall, the tavern's owner laughed. Then he began weeping - his face painted by madness.\n\nThese were not people who would forget seeing Khada Jhin's work.\n\nShen scanned the faces of the onlookers.\n\n''Clever boy'', Jhin thought, before fading into the back of the crowd.\n\nHe checked the rooftops for Zed as he walked back to the ship.\n\nThe work was inescapable. Together or apart, Zed and Shen would chase the clues he had left. They would follow them back to the Blossom Festival. Back to Jyom Pass. And when they became desperate, then they would have to work together again.\n\nIt would be like it had been when they were young. They would huddle together in awe and fear.\n\nOnly then would the great Khada Jhin reveal himself...\n\nAnd his true masterpiece would begin.\n\n", "id": 202}, "Soraka": {"key": "Soraka", "name": "Soraka", "title": "the Starchild", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Soraka\n|alias        = * The Starchild\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nSoraka Render.png|Current\nSoraka Divine Render.png|Pre-Fall\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Fallen)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Ionia|Astral Grove]]\n|residence    = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Traveling Healer\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Warwick, Karthus\n|related      =\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\nA healer gifted with the magic of the stars, Soraka holds all living creatures close to her heart.

A being of the stars, she healed the wounded and sick that sought her out. One man called {{ci|Warwick}} came to her grove and begged her to heal his wife, who lay lifeless in his arms. His despair touched Soraka's heart. Though it was too late to save his wife, she offered to help heal the pain of his loss. Unwilling to let go of his grief Warwick ran from the grove, but returned over the following days to hear Soraka's guidance. She began to grow attached to the grieving man. One day Warwick told her he had found the men who killed his wife. He believed revenge would heal his pain &amp;ndash; and if he died fighting, he would at least find peace. Though she pleaded with him, Warwick ignored her and left the grove. The voices of the stars warned her not to follow him, but Soraka had to intervene.\n\nShe stepped into the mortal world for the first time, and soon found Warwick desperately fighting a group of men.

Crying out in terror and shielding their eyes from her divine radiance, they fled. Soraka's celestial form faded and the stars fell silent &amp;ndash; for her transgression, she became mortal. She still felt the power of the stars within her, but they no longer offered her guidance. She took comfort in Warwick's safety, gently healing his wounds, but the man she had called her friend slipped a dagger between her ribs. As her blood spilled, Soraka realized he had fooled her, and everything he had done was a complicated ruse. Feeling humiliated and betrayed she called once more on the power of the stars, searing his flesh and cursing his cruelty. He retreated with an agonized howl, leaving Soraka to reflect upon her fate. Though her life had changed, she felt empowered and renewed with a singular purpose.

The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality.

Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that, even at its small stature, it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is such a twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on [[Valoran]].\n\nAs a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world beyond [[Bandle City]]. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the world, a deal with Noxian traders turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of [[Noxus]] for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.\n\nHe eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land.

This expedition took him deep into unknown waters where he and his crew found a vast section of the ocean's rich blue waves were replaced by a black, oozing liquid that none of the crew could identify. Though their job was to investigate anything new that they found, no man aboard was willing to brave the murk except Nautilus. Only moments after he donned the hulking diver's suit and climbed over the ship's rail, something lurking in the muck grabbed hold of him. He clung to the side of the ship, but the thing below pulled him fiercely, rocking the entire ship. The other sailors grew afraid and made a terrible decision. As he stared and pled for help, they wrenched his grip free of the rail. He tumbled to the ink, grabbing the anchor in futile desperation. As he sank, he could do nothing but watch as the dark outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.\n\nWhen Nautilus awoke, he was something different. The great iron suit was now somehow part of him, he could not tell where it ended and he began. All the details of his memory were fuzzy and indistinct but one fact remained clear: he was left here, alone in the sunless depths, to die. In his hands he still clutched the anchor that belonged to the men who had condemned him. Having no other purpose, he took this clue and trudged - too heavy to swim or run &amp;ndash; in search of answers. He wandered without direction or sense of passing time in what felt like an eternal dream. By the time he stumbled upon the shores of [[Bilgewater]], he could find no traces of the man he was.

While Evelynn is clearly not entirely human, and her heritage remains unclear, it is believed that she hails from the [[Shadow Isles]] - though her link with that tortured realm remains shrouded in mystery.\n\n;The Shadows Beckon\nSaito Takeda leaned his elbows upon the lacquered surface of his desk, the thick leather of his gloves creaking as he steepled his fingers. What had once been heavy slabs of muscle in years gone by had slowly given way to fat, but he was still a big, intimidating man. His gaze was inscrutable, his eyes having long been replaced with soulless, reflective black lenses.\n\nA pair of heavily augmented bodyguards stood to either side of him. They were the best money could buy, their bodies having been turned into brutal chem-tech weapons by the brilliant, albeit deranged, scientist {{ci|Singed}}.\n\nTakeda's inherent violence and ambition had seen him rise from humble beginnings to become one of [[Zaun]]'s most powerful chem-barons, the infamous rulers of the undercity. Today he planned the downfall of yet another of his rivals.\n\n''&quot;Bring her in, Ortos&quot;'', he said, through a cloud of exhaled smoke.\n\nUnseen chains rattled and pulled taut, and the dark iron doors to his office ground open. Two more bodyguards stood to mute attention outside. One could never be too careful. Takeda had learned that the hard way, as his many scars attested.\n\nTakeda's shaven-headed chamberlain, Ortos, stepped forward, leading a petite figure to the entrance.\n\nShadows clung to her, making it difficult to see her clearly, though Takeda glimpsed a flash of blue-tinged flesh and a pair of {{ai|Agony's Embrace|Evelynn|predator's eyes}} that reflected the chem-fire sconces of his office. He felt an unfamiliar tremor of apprehension at her appearance, but forced it aside. He was one of the most feared men in Zaun. Why should he feel uneasy in his own office?\n\n''&quot;The Lady {{ci|Evelynn}}&quot;'', Ortos announced.\n\nTakeda waved a gloved hand, and Ortos retreated, the doors grinding shut behind him. Evelynn sauntered forward, moving with sublime grace, the heels of her boots echoing sharply.\n\nShe came to a halt on the other side of Takeda's wide desk, and planted her hands on her hips. He could see her more clearly as the shadows retreated to the corners of the room.\n\nHer slender figure was clad in gleaming red leather, and her eyes were yellow and almond-shaped, like those of a cat. A wild mane of crimson hair framed her face, and sharp canines glinted as her lips parted in a sardonic smile.\n\n''&quot;I've been called many things&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;but a lady? That's a new one.&quot;''\n\nTakeda leaned back in his seat, considering her. ''&quot;Around here, most call you the Widowmaker.&quot;''\n\nEvelynn shrugged. ''&quot;At least it's accurate.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I've never married, myself&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;But the one I want you to kill, the Baron Artega Holt, has a wife. Two of them, actually, and a throng of mistresses.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He sounds perfectly charming. I'm sure they'll miss him dearly&quot;'', purred Evelynn. ''&quot;I shall be glad to make his acquaintance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Before I commission you, I need some kind of assurance&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;How do I know you are the right one for this job?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You would have me prove myself, like some back-alley cut-throat?&quot;'' she asked, a hint of irritation in her voice. ''&quot;Has it been so long since I stepped foot in Zaun that I really need to audition?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We hear something of your exploits from time to time. That [[Demacia]]n knight-commander assassinated last year; that was you, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn gave a slow nod. ''&quot;It was.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And the heir of Clan Kozari, in [[Piltover]] last week?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn's expression hardened.\n\n''&quot;No, that was not me&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;That was the Gray Lady.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Ah&quot;'', mused Takeda. ''&quot;Interesting. Well, I guess it proves that reputations and gossip can never truly be relied upon. I'll trust what I see with my own eyes.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I'm afraid this might leave you disappointed&quot;'', hissed Evelynn.\n\nThe blue-skinned assassin took a step back and instantly {{ai|Shadow Walk|Evelynn|disappeared into shadow}}. Takeda's bodyguards tensed, flexing their piston-strengthened limbs in unease. Takeda glanced left and right, trying to discern her location. Nothing. She was simply gone, vanished completely, as if she had been swallowed by the darkness.\n\n''&quot;Not bad&quot;'', he said. He'd heard of her power, of course, but such things are often over-exaggerated. He was pleased to see that in this case, the rumors were true.\n\n{{ai|Ravage|Evelynn|Taloned hands}} grabbed him from behind, blood red nails digging into his flesh as Evelynn emerged from the shadows. She was far stronger than she looked, and forcibly turned his head to expose his thick neck. Her grasp was ice-cold, as if warm blood no longer flowed in her veins, and her fangs were inches from his jugular.\n\nHis guards turned instantly, stepping forward to defend their master, but Takeda raised a hand, stopping them in their tracks. He knew they would have been too slow had she truly wished to end his life.\n\n''&quot;What do you think?&quot;'' breathed Evelynn through bared teeth, her chilled breath caressing his throat. ''&quot;Impressed yet?&quot;''\n\nTakeda snorted.\n\n''&quot;Not bad at all&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;Yes, you will do nicely. Now, let us discuss my offer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I hope you can afford me&quot;'', she hissed, tightening her grip, and leaning closer. ''&quot;I don't want you to have wasted my time here.&quot;''\n\nTakeda swallowed uncomfortably. ''&quot;I don't think that will be an issue&quot;'', he said.\n\nEvelynn released him with a shove, and sat on the edge of his table. She stretched like a cat, completely at ease.\n\n''&quot;You haven't yet asked my price&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Whatever it is, I can pay it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Money holds no interest to me, Saito&quot;'', she said.\n\nTakeda furrowed his brow. ''&quot;Then what is it you want?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Much more than you will be willing to give, I'm thinking&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;But I believe you'll come around.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is not the way things work here&quot;'', growled Takeda. ''&quot;I own this district. No one makes demands of me.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You've seen only a fraction of what I can do&quot;'', said Evelynn. She leaned back, smiling. ''&quot;I'm in the perfect position to make a few demands.&quot;''\n\nTakeda said nothing. His body was tense. He opened his mouth to speak but Evelynn interrupted him, holding up a finger.\n\n''&quot;Don't say anything rash, my dear&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;You'd be dead before the words left your lips.&quot;''\n\nTakeda stared at her, frozen in indecision.\n\n''&quot;Very wise&quot;'', Evelynn said, after giving it a moment. She stood, moved back around the desk, and strode toward the door.\n\n''&quot;Artega Holt will be dead before sunup&quot;'', she said, without looking back. ''&quot;I'll be in touch about my first payment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'''First''' payment?&quot;'' said Takeda.\n\n''&quot;The first of many&quot;'', she said, pausing to look back at him. ''&quot;You'd be wise to remember that I can strike wherever there is darkness. And Zaun is such a dark place.&quot;''\n\nShe nodded toward the door, raising an eyebrow. Takeda growled an order, and the doors swung open. Before she left, Evelynn gave him a wink.\n\n''&quot;Don't take it too hard&quot;'', she said, as she melded into the darkness. ''&quot;So long as you don't irritate me, this partnership will work out well for us both.&quot;''\n\nTakeda sat alone in silence. After a few minutes, his chamberlain peered into the room.\n\n''&quot;Can I get you anything, my lord?&quot;'' Ortos said.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Saito Takeda through gritted teeth. He slammed a fist onto his desk. ''&quot;Leave me. All of you, leave me. And stoke the furnace.

Impulsive and unpredictable, this rowdy carouser loves cracking kegs as much as cracking heads. Thanks to his strange brews and {{ai|Drunken Rage|Gragas|temperamental nature}}, drinking with Gragas is always a risky proposition.\n\nGragas has an eternal love of good drink, but his massive constitution prevented him from reaching a divine state of intoxication. One night, when he had drained all the kegs and was left wanting, Gragas was struck by a thought rather than the usual barstool: why couldn't he brew himself something that would finally get him truly drunk? It was then that he vowed to create the ultimate ale.\n\nGragas' quest eventually brought him to the [[Freljord]], where the promise of acquiring the purest arctic water for his recipe led him into uncharted glacial wastes. While lost in an unyielding blizzard, Gragas stumbled upon a great [[howling abyss]]. There he found it: a flawless shard of ice unlike anything he had ever seen. Not only did this unmelting shard imbue his lager with incredible properties, but it also had a handy side effect - it kept the mixture chilled at the perfect serving temperature.\n\nUnder the spell of his new concoction, Gragas headed for civilization, eager to share the fermented fruits of his labor. As fate would have it, the first gathering to catch Gragas' bleary eyes would shape the future of the Freljord. He blundered into a deteriorating negotiation between two tribes discussing an alliance with {{ci|Ashe}}. Though Ashe welcomed a break in the tension, the other warriors bristled at the intrusion and hurled insults at the drunken oaf. True to his nature, Gragas replied with {{ai|Body Slam|Gragas|a diplomatic headbutt}}, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.\n\nWhen the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas' brew. Although strife was averted and Gragas hailed a hero, he still had not achieved his dream of drunken blissfulness. So once more, he set off to wander the tundra in search of ingredients for [[Runeterra]]'s perfect pint.\n\n", "id": 79}, "Zed": {"key": "Zed", "name": "Zed", "title": "the Master of Shadows", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zed\n|alias        = * The Master of Shadows\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Razor Shuriken|Zed}}\n* {{ai|Death Mark|Zed|Shadow Blades}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Death Mark|Zed|(Plasma Cut 2250R Dual &quot;Strikers&quot;}}{{w|Alternative future|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Zed Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Ionia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Ionia|Kinkou Monastery]], [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Master of The Order of the Shadow \n*&lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiative member{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Ionia_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* The Order of the Shadow\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Syndra\n|rivals       = Shen, Akali, Kennen\n|enemies      = Gangplank, Jhin\n|related = [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "= Lore ==\n{{cbi|Zed}} is the first ninja in 200 years to unlock the ancient, forbidden ways.

Only one other student appeared to be '''Zed's''' equal - the master's son, {{cbi|Shen}}. It seemed '''Zed''' could never win the favor of the master, as every match between the rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he found an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, '''Zed''' knew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden. Now armed with a secret edge, he challenged {{cbi|Shen}}, and this time he defeated the master's son. He expected praise and recognition in his moment of victory, but somehow the master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and banished him.\n\nHumiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to ambition, and he began to train others in the style of the shadows. As his power grew, so did his circle of followers, but he knew that without the box, his technique would never be perfect. One day, '''Zed''' looked at his followers and saw that his students were now an army. He led them back to the temple to claim his prize. At the gates, he was surprised to find the old master waiting, receiving '''Zed''' and his disciples as if they were welcome guests. The old man laid his sword at '''Zed's''' feet, declaring that he had failed '''Zed''' as his master. By banishing his former student, the master had doomed '''Zed''' to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced path. The old man implored '''Zed''' to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his followers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard '''Zed''' cry out in pain. Mysteriously, he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at {{cbis|Shen}} feet. Screaming in rage, '''Zed''' commanded his followers to slaughter the master's students and seize the box.\n\nThat day, the [[Kinkou|old ninja order]] fell.

Vi's brash attitude, abrasive humor, and blatant refusal to follow orders can often infuriate her by-the-books partner, {{ci|Caitlyn}}. But even the sheriff of Piltover cannot deny that Vi is an invaluable asset in the fight against crime.\n\nAs a child growing up in the lawless outskirts of Piltover, Vi learned to rob and cheat to get by. Stealing and stripping hextech hardware gave her the skills of a master mechanic, while life on the streets taught her self-reliance. When she was six, a ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.\n\nVi's attitude changed when a raid on a mining facility went bad. She was forced to decide between fleeing with her crew or trying to save the innocent mine workers from a collapsed tunnel. Vi chose to play the hero. While searching for a way to free the mine workers from the rubble, she discovered a damaged robotic mining rig. Improvising, she wrenched off its huge fists and modified them into makeshift hextech gauntlets. Fitting the heavy weapons to her tiny hands, the young girl flexed her arm and threw a powered punch at the rubble. The force of the blow blasted away the rock. With the workers free to escape, Vi fled the scene.\n\nAfter that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals. As the years went by, Vi modified and improved her hextech fists, allowing her to bust up heists and snatch loot with ease. Eventually, word of her notoriety reached Caitlyn, the famed Sheriff of Piltover. Rather than seek Vi's arrest, Caitlyn offered the criminal a way to pay her debt to society: work for the law in Piltover. Vi laughed. To her, a job that let her beat up crooks without forcing her to run from the cops sounded perfect. She immediately accepted. Caitlyn now struggles to keep Vi in line, and Vi treats Caitlyn's orders as mere suggestions, but when they work together, they are feared by all lawbreakers in Piltover.\n\n{{quote|&quot;It's a shame.

Some families fled. Some prayed. Others held their loved ones close and wept. Fifty brave souls prepared to fight. They cleaned the dirt from their pitchforks and bound knives to broom handles.\n\nMounting panic shone in the eyes of every defender; they knew they had no hope. With the dust of the Noxian advance already visible in the distance, there was little to do but make peace with their gods. The sons and daughters of Ionia took deep, steadying breaths of mountain air, gazed into the starry twilight, and waited for the slaughter soon to come.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\n{{ci|Ahri}}'s nine tails swished: a nervous tic. Her sharpened senses warned of danger. Crouched in the shadow of a towering willow she listened, watched, and waited. She had observed the villagers for weeks: watching from afar, but never trusting herself to approach. She heard families talking over dinner, the laughs of women who might have been her sisters, and the games of children. Ahri would listen for hours on end, tearing herself away only when the longing grew too sharp.\n\nThough she had little understanding of nations or politics, instinct alone told her something was very wrong in the world today. Curious, and fearing for the villagers, Ahri sniffed the air. She pinpointed the source of her disquiet, and dashed into the night.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\nSeven Noxian scouts eased through the brush, pushing ever closer to the mountain. Dark-eyed and wary, the men kept their hands on their weapons as they crept through the settling dusk.\n\nAhri found them in a matter of moments and followed them through the forest. She darted between the trees, suspicion mounting as she observed their movements. Of their mission Ahri could only guess, but she had fought enough battles to know killers when she saw them.\n\nThe squad's captain scanned the undergrowth. Without breaking stride he whispered a brief order to the man at his back, who relayed it to the man at his. Ahri thought nothing of it, and continued her silent pursuit.\n\nSuddenly, seven hands reached for seven arrows.\n\n''&quot;Now!&quot;'' roared the captain. The Noxians loosed as one, and a flurry of hawk-fletched arrows flashed towards Ahri.\n\nShe dived from the bushes as two arrows sliced through her sleeve. Ahri ripped it off and dashed into cover, yellow eyes aflame with shock and fury. She would lose no sleep in killing these men.\n\nAhri opened her palms to the sky, and felt the raw power of her spirit coalesce. Her nine tails fanned out in all directions as she pulled white fire from the air with a snarl. With a flick of her wrist, Ahri summoned {{ai|Fox-Fire|Ahri|three motes of spinning flame}}. She dodged another volley of arrows before leaping for the nearest tree, coiling her tails to spring from its trunk, back towards her assailants. The Noxians scattered as she landed in their midst. The man closest to her thrust a knife, but the blade cut only air. Ahri danced through her foes with {{ai|Spirit Rush|Ahri|blinding speed}}.\n\nThe fiery motes around her engulfed the three nearest men. White flames seared them, but Ahri had more than brute force in her arsenal. She vaulted from tree to tree, rising higher with every bound. She spotted the squad's captain crouched between a tangle of tree roots, his bowstring taut. Given half a chance, Ahri knew he'd put an arrow through her eye. She crept silently to the branches above the captain's shelter and spoke, her soft words laced with beguiling power.\n\n''&quot;Human&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Come to me.&quot;''\n\nThe captain's features went slack. Through no will of his own, he set down his bow and walked from cover. He looked up, eyes wide with desperation and desire.\n\n''&quot;Now climb&quot;'', said Ahri, blowing the man a {{ai|Charm|Ahri|kiss}}.\n\nThe captain, utterly in her thrall, scrambled for footholds on the tree trunk. Ahri summoned {{ai|Orb of Deception|Ahri|a sphere of lambent energy}} to her palm, its innocent appearance belying its vast power. She drew back her arm, allowed herself a vulpine grin, and hurled it downwards.\n\nThe orb streaked through the captain before flying back to Ahri palm, and his smoking body fell to the forest floor with a thud. The remaining scouts fled in terror, but running proved every bit as futile as hiding. Ahri vaulted from branch to branch, tails whirling behind her as she struck two men down with thunderous bolts of energy.\n\nThe last man collapsed in a tangle of limbs, clutching at his broken bones as Ahri landed gracefully beside him. She grabbed the Noxian's throat, and put her face an inch from his.\n\n''&quot;You brought this on yourselves&quot;'', she hissed, and snapped the man's neck with a blast of concussive force.\n\nOnly one task remained.\n\nAhri had no qualms about gaining her humanity by taking it from men who had no use for it. She knelt over the fallen Noxian, feeling his pulse fade. She placed her hands to either side of his face. The light of his {{ai|Essence Theft|Ahri|essence}} flowed from his eyes and mouth, and a thrilling sensation surged through Ahri. His humanity poured into her, and she felt the fox within withdraw with every heartbeat. Her tails curled in pleasure, her expression rapturous.\n\nYet even lost in that glorious sensation, Ahri heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The villagers, hearing the sounds of combat, were coming to investigate. She couldn't let them see her like this, draining what remained of a dying man's life. To their eyes she would seem a terrifying mystery: a damnable half-breed stray, neither human nor beast.\n\nReluctantly, Ahri turned from her feast, seeing shapes moving through the trees and bushes. She recognized the men and women she had watched from afar, remembering the friendship she hoped they might one day share.\n\nBut today was not that day, and Ahri turned to flee into the woods.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 2.png|center|650px]]\n\n", "id": 103}, "Quinn": {"key": "Quinn", "name": "Quinn", "title": "Demacia's Wings", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Quinn and Valor\n|alias = Demacia's Wings\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Harrier|Quinn|Crossbow}} &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Blinding Assault|Quinn|Claws}} &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Quinn Valor Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n{{w|Male|\u2642}} Male &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|race = \n* Human &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* Demacian Eagle &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Demacian Rural Town, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = Demacian Elite Ranger Team\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Jarvan IV\n|rivals = Talon\n|related = [[Journey into the Freljord]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "lt;tabber&gt;\n\n00=\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Most soldiers only rely on their weapons.

The pair's unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents blind and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: not one, but two [[Demacia]]n legends.\n\nAs a young girl, Quinn shared a hunger for adventure with her twin brother. They dreamed of becoming knights, but lived a quiet, humble life in the rural borderlands of Demacia. Together they imagined triumphant battles in faraway lands, seizing glory for their king and slaying foes in the name of Demacian justice. When daydreams alone could no longer satisfy their warrior souls, they embarked on daring wilderness adventures in search of true danger. One such quest turned to tragedy when a terrible accident claimed her brother's life. Overcome with grief, Quinn abandoned her dreams of knighthood.\n\nOn the anniversary of her loss, Quinn gathered the courage to return to the scene of the tragedy. To her surprise, she found a wounded Demacian eagle at the site of her brother's death - a rare and beautiful bird long believed extinct. Quinn nursed the fledgling back to health, and as they grew up together, a deep bond formed between the two. She saw the same quality in her newfound friend that had lived within her brother, and so she gave him the name 'Valor'. The pair found strength in each other, and together they pursued the dream she had once abandoned.\n\nThe Demacian army had never seen heroes like Quinn and Valor. Their deadly skills quickly set them apart from their rank-and-file peers, but many still had their doubts. How could a common-born girl, even with such a powerful creature at her side, forego years of military training? Quinn and Valor proved themselves on one critical mission, tracking down a [[Noxus|Noxian]] assassin who had evaded an entire Demacian battalion. When they brought him to justice, they finally earned the admiration and respect of their nation. The two now serve as living, fighting icons of Demacian strength and perseverance. Together, Quinn and Valor will stand against any threat to their beloved home.\n\n|-|01=\n[[File:Quinn's Journal p0.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|02=\n[[File:Quinn's Journal p1.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|03=\n[[File:Quinn's Journal p2.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|04=\n[[File:Quinns Journal p3.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|05=\n[[File:Quinns Journal p4.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|06=\n[[File:Quinns Journal p5.jpg|center|550px]]\n|-|07=\n[[File:Quinns Journal p6.jpg|center|550px]]\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 133}, "Leblanc": {"key": "Leblanc", "name": "LeBlanc", "title": "the Deceiver", "meta": "{{Champion bio|LeBlanc\n|real_name = Evaine\n|alias = \n* The Deceiver\n* Matron LeBlanc\n* The Pale Woman\n|render = LeBlanc Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = Matron of [[The Black Rose]]\n|faction    = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n* [[File:Black Rose.png|20px|link=]] [[The Black Rose]]\n|allies = Sion\n|friends = Swain, Elise, Vladimir\n|enemies = \n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The world is very different for those who cannot see beyond what is placed before their very eyes.&quot;'' - {{ci|LeBlanc}}, the Deceiver&lt;/center&gt;\n\n", "background": "very city has its dark side, even one whose reputation is already of a questionable hue.\n\n[[Noxus]] - though its name is already invoked with a mixture of reverence and revulsion - is no exception to this simple truth.

Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government.\n\nIn those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power. While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus.\n\nWhen raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance.\n\nWhen LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: [[the League of Legends]].\n\n", "id": 7}, "Ezreal": {"key": "Ezreal", "name": "Ezreal", "title": "the Prodigal Explorer", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Ezreal\n|alias = \n* The Prodigal Explorer\n* Grandmaster Explorer\n* Professor Lyte's Nephew\n|weapon_pet = \n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal|(PEARL}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nEzreal Render.png|Current\nEzreal Explorer Render.png|Explorer\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Cartographer\n* Piltover Grandmaster Explorer\n* &lt;small&gt;(Pulsefire Warrior {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux, Jayce, Caitlyn, Vi\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/pulsefire-ezreal/en.html Pulsefire Armory]\n* [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima]\n* [[Arcade]]\n}}\n\n", "background": "he intrepid young adventurer {{ci|Ezreal}} has explored some of the most remote and abandoned locations on [[Runeterra]].
