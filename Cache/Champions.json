It remained there untouched for centuries, emanating a potent magic which infused nearby wildlife with sentience and vitality. A group of monkeys who were particularly empowered by it came to worship the stone, and their leader - a wise sage - became convinced that he could harness its power to make the monkeys immortal. He performed an elaborate ritual, but things didn't go as he expected. The runestone was destroyed, and instead of granting immortality, it produced Kong, a monkey who carried in his heart the strength and power it had contained. Kong was driven by an unquenchable desire for greatness. He sought out every beast and monster the Plague Jungles could offer, eager to find a worthy opponent, but none offered the challenge he craved. He asked the sage for advice, and learned about a legend of hairless monkeys to the north who, with wits and might, had bent the world to their will.\n\nKong left, journeying north, determined to discover if the legend was true. He crossed the Southern Wastes and then the Great Barrier. On his way, he happened upon {{ci|Master Yi}}, who was deep in meditation. Kong asked him who the strongest warrior in the north was, and Yi told him about [[the League of Legends]]. The tale intoxicated Kong, a place where he could battle the strongest fighters in the world was, to him, paradise. Kong asked Yi to introduce him to this League, and to teach him the ways of humans, so that he could be a fitting champion. In return, he would honor Yi by using Yi's Wuju style to become the greatest warrior Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed, but under the condition that Kong would one day teach the lessons of Wuju to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong ''Wukong,'' and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that the young Doran had crafted. The weapon was an unrivalled masterpiece. Guided by Yi, Wukong joined the League of Legends to prove himself as the best, and to show the world the true power of Wuju.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Only in combat do you learn who you truly are.&quot;|'''Wukong'''}}\n{{clr}}\n== Quotes ==\n;Upon selection\n* {{sm2|Wukong Select.ogg|''&quot;I will be the best.&quot;''}}\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nClassic=\n;Attacking\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack1.ogg|''&quot;Wuju style.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack2.ogg|''&quot;Put me to the test.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack3.ogg|''&quot;I got this.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack4.ogg|''&quot;Just try to stop me.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack5.ogg|''&quot;Is that all they've got?&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.attack6.ogg|''&quot;Been waiting for this.&quot;''}}\n\n;Movement\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move1.ogg|''&quot;You got it!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move2.ogg|''&quot;Show me the path.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move3.ogg|''&quot;My place is at the top.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move4.ogg|''&quot;Adapt to all situations.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move5.ogg|''&quot;Bring me a real challenge.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move6.ogg|''&quot;Who questions my ability?&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move7.ogg|''&quot;Every mistake is a lesson.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move8.ogg|''&quot;Never settle for second.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Wukong.move9.ogg|''&quot;My journey's only beginning.&quot;''}}\n\n;Taunt\n* {{sm2|Wukong.taunt.ogg|''&quot;Improve your skills!

The promise of a challenge excites him. His movements seem frenzied and wild, but for all their apparent disorganization, he never seems to be off-balance. His head darts from side to side. It's unclear whether he is watching for threats or trying to take everything in at once \u2013 probably both.\n\nWhen he is satisfied that has seen or poked everything in the area, he proceeds to the doors. This moment has been too long in the waiting.\n\n;REFLECTION\n\nWukong was still unaccustomed to the confining structures that humans liked to build around themselves. He could understand the need for shelter, but in a place where man's society dominated the landscape, there weren't many dangers left. Master Yi had explained the concept of &quot;privacy&quot; to him at length (mainly because Wukong's prying curiosity apparently often violated it), but he still didn't quite understand why people would willingly spend so much time cut off from the world around them. Did they not enjoy the sun on their skin? Or the scents carried on the wind? Maybe it's just a fur thing, he mused.\n\nIn the Plague Jungles, Wukong would spend nights on the highest bough of the tallest tree, drifting asleep to the melody of thousands of creatures serenading the starlight. Despite all the wonders man had achieved, nothing had quite the same simple elegance. It seemed the nature of people was to seek out and foster complications in their lives until even the most fundamental behaviors came with guidelines and instructions: table manners, bathroom etiquette, courting rituals, rules of engagement. To breach any rule was to invite further complications. It was exhausting and often pointless.\n\nHowever, for all the quirks that humans had, they were truly remarkable, and their warriors presented Wukong with challenges he couldn't find in the Plague Jungles \u2013 challenges he once worried might not exist. He recalled the feeling of desperation that day, right after his bout with the sea dragon, when his every goal had been realized, every opponent defeated. His frantic ambition gave him drive and purpose, but consumed him when deprived an outlet. Like him, it was a product of the Plague Jungles, where uneven concentrations of magic and life would well up until they burst \u2013 evolution in overdrive.\n\nThe nearby crunch of a crushed leaf jarred him from his thoughts.\n\nInstinctively, Wukong bent backward, just in time to avoid the sweep of a familiar weapon. As it passed over him, he could make out Doran's distinctive craftsmanship \u2013 it was his own staff. Had someone stolen it? His focus fell to his fingers and he was relieved to find it still clutched within them.\n\nWukong allowed his momentum to carry him into a backflip, and he brought the weapon up defensively the second his feet touched the soil. Soil...where am I? He glanced at his surroundings and recognized the vibrant ferns, towering kopak trees, and sprawling vines in an instant.\n\nHow had he returned to the Plague Jungles? More importantly, who had just attacked him?\n\nHe scanned the immediate area but could find no sign of the aggressor. There was no way anyone could have gotten away so fast. He peered through the lush vegetation, looking for signs of someone's passing. He had the space of a gasp to notice a curious shadow before he was struck squarely in the chest by a jab from the imposter weapon. It came from nearly twenty feet away, stretching several times its normal length to reach him. Knockoff or not, it apparently shared the unique qualities of the original.\n\nThe blow knocked the wind out of him, and sent him sliding along the jungle's mossy floor. He stayed on his feet, but struggled to maintain his composure as he coaxed air back into his lungs. A blur in the corner of his vision announced the next assault, and Wukong was able to identify his assailant's glinting gold armor before he was beset by a flurry of attacks. The form was unmistakable.\n\nIt's...me?\n\nOn his heels, Wukong could barely keep upright as he parried the furious onslaught. The rogue clone was faster than he was, and its strikes were well-chosen and well-placed. Wukong tried to control the clone as he would one of his own illusions, although he was unsurprised when that failed. This clone wasn't one of his tricks, it was something different entirely. Had the jungle produced another, possibly better monkey king? He was horrified by the thought.\n\nWukong saw an opening in the clone's barrage, and he unleashed a powerful blow. He timed it perfectly \u2013 the clone had no time to react before Wukong's staff collided with its jaw.\n\nWhen he made contact, the clone vanished in a puff of smoke.\n\nUh oh. Wukong knew this tactic all too well. He tried to block the attack he knew would come from behind but he wasn't fast enough. Bright pain filled his vision and he collapsed face-first into mud and ferns. As he tried to blink the world back into his eyes, the clone circled him slowly, savoring its advantage.\n\n&quot;Why do you want to join the League, Wukong?&quot; The question, delivered in his own voice, rattled him.\n\n&quot;To be the best,&quot; he rasped, spitting dirt.\n\n&quot;You have a long way to go.&quot;\n\n&quot;That's the fun part.&quot; Wukong got to one knee. &quot;When you're at the top, there's nowhere left to go.&quot; He eyed the clone curiously, perhaps things weren't as they seemed. &quot;But I'm not as far away as you think.&quot;\n\nHe grinned mischievously, and the clone lashed out with its staff, sensing danger. All it hit was a cloud of smoke. Wukong hurtled through the air behind it, one hand latched onto a vine, the other holding the staff out like a lance. The clone whirled around faster than the eye could see, its staff cutting a vicious arc for Wukong. It hit its mark perfectly, and just in time, but Wukong just burst into another cloud.\n\nThe trees were coming alive now. Another Wukong swung down from a vine, then another, and another. The clone moved like a machine, barely intercepting every attack but slowly becoming obscured in fog as they all dispersed harmlessly in front of it. It tried to move, to find some better ground, but Wukongs poured from the trees, surrounding and suppressing it with unrelenting strikes. One Wukong stood outside the cloud, arms folded, watching as the clone struggled to resist being overwhelmed.\n\n&quot;You know, human, things are different in the Plague Jungles. We aren't provided for, we aren't protected. Most creatures don't fight for fun here \u2013 most fight to survive.&quot; He ducked as the clone's staff, shooting out from the cloud, sought to land a lucky strike. &quot;But I fight to be the best. That's what makes me special. That's why I left to find your League. That's why I will be the greatest.&quot;\n\nThe clone was visibly losing steam. Wukong plucked a peach from a nearby tree and took a bite. It tasted divine.\n\n&quot;As a people, you have the world at your fingertips, but alone, most of you crumble in the face of true adversity,&quot; he slurped through a mouthful of peach.\n\nSuddenly, before his eyes, the jungle dissolved. He dropped the peach, but it was gone before it reached the ground. Only the clone remained against a backdrop of darkness. Its eyes burned brightly, but its expression was pleased.\n\n&quot;How does it feel, exposing your mind?&quot;\n\nWukong tapped the clone on the shoulder from behind, the Wukong it was facing vanished, leaving the same poof of smoke.\n\n&quot;I told you I wasn\u2019t as far as you thought,&quot; he said with a smile.\n\nScowling, the clone disappeared and then Wukong was back in the Institute. He chuckled. Humans and their rituals. Nonetheless, another trial passed, another obstacle overcome. Now it was time to put this League to the test.\n}}\n", "background": "\n", "id": 62}, "Jax": {"key": "Jax", "name": "Jax", "title": "Grandmaster at Arms", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jax\n|alias = Grandmaster at Arms\n|weapon_pet = Brass Lamppost\n|render = Jax Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown \n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = Mercenary\n|faction = \n* Independent\n|allies = \n|friends = Gragas\n|rivals = Fiora\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Be advised - there has been an outbreak of lamppost-shaped bruises in [[the League of Legends]].&quot;'' - {{ci|Gragas}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIt is seldom the case where a [[champion]] is defined by his actions after joining the League of Legends rather than before. Such is the case with {{ci|Jax}}, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War.\n\nBefore joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.\n\nHis Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began. Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the [[Fields of Justice]]. The self-proclaimed 'Armsmaster of the League' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched.\n\nA number of [[summoner]]s in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable.\n\nFor this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under.\n\nThis was something the League had never done before, and something which has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways.\n\nThe League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n", "id": 24}, "Shaco": {"key": "Shaco", "name": "Shaco", "title": "the Demon Jester", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shaco\n|alias      = * The Demon Jester\n|render     = [[File:Shaco Render.png|245px|link=]]\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race       = Unknown\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = * Homicidal Jester\n|faction    = * Independent\n|allies     =\n|friends    = Fiddlesticks, Nocturne\n|rivals     =\n|related    =\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.---&gt;\n:''This lore is out-dated and is no longer considered {{w|canon}}.''\nMost would say that death isn't funny. It isn't, unless you're Shaco - then it's hysterical. He is [[Valoran|Valoran's]] first fully functioning homicidal comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is that Shaco is not of [[Runeterra]] - that he is a thing summoned from a dark and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation of humanity's dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at large.\n\nWhatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined [[the League of Legends]] for reasons only he knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned by both his fellow [[champion]]s and the media at large. Only the [[summoners]] in the [[Institute of War]] know why such a creature was allowed into the League, but most Runeterrans suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be to keep an eye on the ever-elusive Shaco. Unsurprisingly, this champion is popular in places where madness can openly reign, such as among the power-hungry summoners of [[Zaun]] and [[Noxus]].\n\n:''&quot;Whatever you do, don't tell him you missed the punch line.&quot;''\n{{clr}}\n\n", "id": 35}, "Warwick": {"key": "Warwick", "name": "Warwick", "title": "the Blood Hunter", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Warwick\n|alias = The Blood Hunter\n|render = Warwick Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Werewolf &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = \n* Manhunter\n* Researcher\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Singed\n|rivals = Vayne\n|enemies = Soraka\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Eventually the beast catches up with all of us.&quot;'' - {{ci|Warwick}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWarwick was once a man revered for his ability to {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|track down}} human specimens for the darkest types of scientific research.

His newfound strength bore a heavy price.\n\nBefore his transformation, Warwick found his calling in [[Zaun]] as a 'procurer' of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner.\n\nTo meet their demands, Warwick needed the strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend, {{ci|Singed}}, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the [[Shadow Isles]], the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge.\n\nHe traveled to [[Ionia]] to trap {{ci|Soraka}}, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick|raw strength}} and {{ai|Blood Scent|Warwick|heightened senses}}.\n\nExhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power. Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further away. He could feel himself losing control: though he always got his prey, he often failed to bring them back alive.

Embodying the furious bravado of his nation, he is an icon beloved by the empire's soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Tall tales such as 'The Great Hussar', 'The High General Marshal Sergeant', and 'The Mountain Admiral' trace back to the founding of the empire. Many soldiers claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has 'acquired' every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the veracity of the details is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, {{ci|Skaarl}}, Kled fights to protect what's his... and to take whatever he can get.\n\n==Lore==\nThe earliest known story of Kled traces back to the empire's infancy and the Battle of Drugne. In the dusty hills of those badlands, the First Legion was on the run from a barbarian horde. Having lost the two previous battles, the men's morale was low, the army had been forced to abandon its supply train in the rout, and they were a week's march from the nearest outpost.\n\nIn command of the Legion was a gaggle of wealthy nobles bedecked in spotless golden armor. They were more concerned with their appearances and the intrigues of their class than the men they were commanding. Worse, these commanders - though well versed in assassination and tournament fighting - had proven hopeless on the field. With the remains of the army surrounded by enemy forces, the nobles ordered the Legion into a defensive circle in hopes of negotiating ransoms for themselves.\n\nThen, as the morning sun rose, the mysterious figure of Kled appeared on the hilltop overlooking the battlefield. He rode Skaarl, an immortal desert drakalops. The mount stood on only two legs; its ear-like forelimbs fanned from the side of its head, hanging down apologetically, like a butler who had accidently dipped his hands in soup.\n\nThe lone rider stood on his steed's saddle. {{ai|Violent Tendencies|Kled|His weapon}} was rusted, his armor was worn, and his clothes were tattered - but a relentless anger burned from his one good eye.\n\n'''''&quot;I'll give you one chance to get off my land!&quot;''''' Kled announced to the barbarian horde, but the [[yordle]] didn't wait for their answer. He spurred his steed and angrily screamed {{ai|Chaaaaaaaarge!!!|Kled|his charge}}.\n\nDesperate, starving, and furious with the nobles, the Legion's anger ignited like blasting powder at the yordle's insane act of bravado. The enlisted men rushed after Kled and Skaarl as they tore into the center of the enemy formation.\n\nWhat followed was the bloodiest melee the Legion had ever fought. The initial success of its surprise attack was crushed when the barbarians' reserve forces smashed into the Legion's flanks. With the battle turning against the Noxians and the enemy attacking from every side, Skaarl [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 2.png|20px|link=]] panicked, threw Kled, and abandoned the fight. Like the cowardly lizard creature, the Noxian soldiers faltered. But at their center, Kled fought on, chopping down foes, kicking out teeth, and biting faces.\n\nEnemy bodies piled around Kled, and his clothes were soaked with blood. Despite the casualties he inflicted with every swing of his long axe, he was still forced back by the barbarians' relentless tide. He screamed louder challenges and cruder insults. Clearly, the yordle was willing to die before ever backing down.\n\nCourage and cowardice are as infectious as the plague, however, and seeing Kled's determination, the legionnaires pressed on. Even Skaarl stopped running and turned to watch the Legion's last stand.\n\nThen, as the Noxian line was breaking and the enemy's superior numbers pulled Kled to the ground, the drakalops triumphantly [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 3.png|20px|link=]] returned and crashed into the barbarians' rear. Snarling and clawing, it dove into the churning melee until it freed its master. With his mount again beneath him, the reinvigorated Kled became a whirlwind of death, and it was the barbarians who broke and ran.\n\nThough precious few of the Noxian soldiers survived, the battle was won. The tribes of Drugne were defeated, and their lands were added to the empire. The bodies of the nobles, and their fine golden armor, were never found.\n\nIn time, most of the empire's other legions acquired similar stories of Kled, proving no defeat is certain in the face of insane courage. It is said he rides wherever the legions travel, claiming the spoils of war and land for himself and Skaarl.\n\nMost Noxians find the truth of these tall tales questionable at best. But in the legions' wake, signs can always be found proclaiming each new territory 'Property of Kled'.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe Northern Steppes ain't the place for fancy undies and golden piss pots. It's tough land. Ain't nothing go here but barbarian raiders, poison grass, and harsh winds. To survive, you gotta eat rocks and crap lava. And I'm the toughest, meanest, killingest bastard in these parts. So I figure that makes these plains mine.\n\n'''''&quot;But how did I end up here? And why am I alone with yer dumb yella hide?&quot;''''' I say out loud, starting it off again.\n\nSkaarl snorts her response from the rock she's sunning herself on. Her scales is dark metal with hints of gold. Ain't nothing can break that drakalops' skin. I've seen a steel sword shatter against her leg.\n\nDon't make her farts smell any better though.\n\n'''''&quot;I'm callin' you a damn coward. You got somethin' to say about that?&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglarg&quot;''''', it says as it looks up and yawns.\n\n'''''&quot;It was a hooked grouse! No bigger than my hand. And you run... Darn dumb, stupid animal!&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Greef... rglarg?&quot;''''' Skaarl asks as it swats the flies away from its half-opened eyes.\n\n'''''&quot;Oh, good retort! Yeah, real funny, right? Ha ha ha! I'm damn tired of yer heretical pontifications. I should leave ya here to die. That's what I should do. You'd die o' loneliness. Hell, you wouldn't last a day without me.&quot;'''''\n\nSkaarl lays its head back down on the rock.\n\nThere ain't no use communicating with her. I should forgive her - but then, and no doubt to mock me, her sphincter splutters rhythmically as she breaks wind. The smell hits me like a frying pan.\n\n'''''&quot;That's it, you bastard!&quot;''''' I throw my stinking hat onto the ground and march away from the campsite, swearing I'll never set eyes on that foul-mouthed drakalops again. 'Course, it was my good hat, so I have to trot back and snatch it off the ground.\n\n'''''&quot;Yeah, keep sleeping, ya lazy flaprat&quot;''''', I say as I walk away. '''''&quot;I'll do the patrol!&quot;'''''\n\nBeing ten moons from any farmstead don't preclude doing the patrol. It's my land. And I aim to keep it that way. With or without that treason-ish lizard's help.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe sun's dragging its way down to the horizon by the time I reach the hills. This time of day, the light plays tricks on you. I meet a snake who wants to discuss pie crusts. Except it ain't a snake, it's the shadow of a rock.\n\nDamn shame. I have some durn specific notions about pie crusts. At least when I remember what they are again. I ain't had a proper conversation about the subject in years.\n\nI'm about to take a swig of my mushroom juice and explain my views to the snake, when I hear them.\n\nDrake hounds howling and braying. It's the sounds those beasts make when they is herding elmarks. And if there's elmarks, then there is humans. And those humans is trespassers.\n\nI scramble up a nearby boulder and check north first.\n\nThe rolling hills of my grasslands is empty, save for the iron buttes scattered across the horizon. The braying sounds might be the mushroom juice playing tricks on my head... But then I turn south.\n\nThey is about a half day's walk from this hill. Three hundred elmarks grazing. Grazing on my land.\n\nThe drake hounds circle around the herd, but there's no horses. A few humans walk around them on foot. Humans don't like walking. So it don't take a genius to figure they must be part of some larger convoy then. 'Course, I am a genius. So that was easy to figure.\n\nMy blood begins to boil. That means more damn trespassers, disturbing my peace. Here, when I was about to have a lovely conversation about pie crusts with that snake.\n\nI take another sip of mush-juice and head back to the campsite.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\n'''''&quot;Get up, lizard!&quot;''''' I say as I grab my saddle.\n\nIt raises its head, grunts a response, and returns to lying in the cool grass.\n\n'''''&quot;Get up! Get up! GIT UP!&quot;''''' I yell. '''''&quot;There's trespassers, invading the peaceful serenity of our environs.&quot;'''''\n\nIt looks at me blankly. I forget sometimes she don't understand me when I'm speaking.\n\nI buckle the saddle onto its back. '''''&quot;There's humans on our land!&quot;'''''\n\nIt stands, and its ears perk up nervously. Humans. That word it knows. I jump into the saddle.\n\n'''''&quot;Let's get those humans!&quot;''''' I roar, indicating our southward destination. But the damn beast immediately starts going north.\n\n'''''&quot;No, No, NO! They's that way! That way!&quot;''''' I say, using my reins to pull the cowardly beast back in the right direction.\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglaaarg!&quot;''''' the drakalops cries as it kicks off. In an instant, she's running. The insane speed of it makes my eyes close. Scrub grass whips painfully against my legs. A cloud of dust billows behind us. What'd take me half a day of walking is past before I can get my hat tied down.\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglorg!&quot;''''' the drakalops screeches.\n\n'''''&quot;Now, don't be like that! Weren't you saying you wanted company last night?&quot;'''''\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\nThe sun is just starting to dip below the horizon when we reach the herd. I slow Skaarl to a trot as we approach the humans' campsite. They'd already started a fire and have a stew going.\n\n'''''&quot;Hold, stranger. Show your hands before you approach&quot;''''', a human in a red hat says. Their leader, I figure.\n\nI slowly take my hands off the reins. But instead of putting them up, I pull {{ai|Violent Tendencies|Kled|my long axe}} from its saddle loop.\n\n'''''&quot;I don't think you understand me, old timer&quot;''''', the human in the red hat says again. His fellows ready weapons: swords, lassos, and a dozen repeater crossbows.\n\n'''''&quot;I got it under control&quot;''''', I tell my lizard, before turning my attention back to the humans. '''''&quot;I ain't impressed with your fancy, city-folk weapons. Now I'm giving you one warning. Get off my land. Or else.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Or else what?&quot;''''' a younger human asks.\n\n'''''&quot;You boys best know who you're dealing with&quot;''''', I say. '''''&quot;This is Skaarl. She's a drakalops. And I'm Kled, Lord Major Admiral of the Second Legion's forward artillery - cavalry multiplication.&quot;'''''\n\nSeveral of the humans start snickering. I'll learn them soon enough - once I'm done talking.\n\n'''''&quot;And what makes you think this is your land?&quot;''''' asks the human in the red hat, smirking.\n\n'''''&quot;It's mine. I took it from them barbarians.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;It's property of Lord Vakhul. He was granted it by the High Command. It's his by rightful dispensation.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Well, High Command! Why didn't you say so?!&quot;''''' I say before spitting on the ground. '''''&quot;The only law a true [[Noxus|Noxian]] respects is strength. He can have it. If he can take it from me.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;You and your pony best be moving on, while you still can.&quot;'''''\n\nI forget sometimes humans don't see us like we see them. It's the last straw though.\n\n'''''{{ai|Chaaaaaaaarge!!!|Kled|&quot;CHARGE!!!!&quot;}}''''' I scream, and snap the reins. The drakalops kicks off, and we rush them. I meant to make a clever retort first, but I got ahead of myself.\n\nThe humans let loose their first volley, but Skaarl raises her ears. Like giant bronze fans, they shield us as the crossbow bolts ricochet off her impenetrable flesh.\n\nShe roars happily as we dive through their camp at the leader in the red hat. Swords clang against Skaarl's hide, while my axe swings. I turn two of them humans into confetti. The bastard in the red hat's quick. He ducks under my blade as we pass by. Another volley of crossbow bolts hits us.\n\nSkaarl screams in fear. Damn thing's unkillable and immortal, but easily spooked. Problem with magical beasties, they don't make no sense.\n\nI yank the reins, and we ride back into the middle of the humans. I easily kill the rest of his men, but the red-hat bastard's a tough one. My blade slams into him - but the blow clangs dully against his heavy breast plate. That should give him something to think about, anyway.\n\nThat's when the ballista fires. The bolt is longer than a wagon. It smashes into the drakalops, knocking my long axe from my hand, and sends us rolling to the ground. Skaarl ain't hurt. But she shakes me off the saddle and [[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 2.png|20px|link=]] runs for the hills.\n\n'''''&quot;You ungrateful bastard! We had the frassa-gimps in the razabutts!&quot;''''' I mean to scream more insults, but my words start tripping over themselves.\n\nI roll to my feet. Dust and grass cover my face. I throw my hat toward the cowardly lizard's path, then turn back to kill the man in the red hat.\n\nBut behind him, on the hill line, is another hundred of them humans. Iron warriors, bloodrunners, and a wagon-mounted ballista. Red-hatted blurf-herder brought most of a legion with him.\n\n'''''&quot;You ain't nothing but a durn sneaky-sneak!&quot;''''' I scream.\n\n'''''&quot;You don't look like much&quot;''''', he says, '''''&quot;but I guess you're the one who's been giving Lord Vakhul's ranchers so much trouble.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Vakhul ain't no real Noxian. Your lordship can kiss my lizard's puckered mudflap!&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;Maybe I'll let you end your days in Lord Vakhul's fighting pits. If you can learn to keep your mouth shut.&quot;'''''\n\n'''''&quot;I'm gonna rip your lips off and use them to wipe my butt!&quot;''''' I roar.\n\nI guess he don't like that, 'cause him and his hundred friends start running at me, weapons drawn. I could run. But I don't. They'll pay dearly to kill me.\n\nRed Hat's fast. He's nearly on me before I can recover my weapon from the ground. His blade is high. He's got the killing stroke. But I've got {{ai|Pocket Pistol|Kled|my hidden scattergun}}.\n\nThe blast sends him to the ground. It knocks me back, too. I tumble end over end. The single shot buys me some time. But not much.\n\nThe bloodrunners are closing fast. Their hooked blades is ready. I'm gonna die in this turd-stain. Well, if it's my last stand, might as well make it a good one.\n\nI dust myself off as the first line of bloodrunners attacks. I'm carving those dark magical bastards apart, but they're cutting me to ribbons. I'm beginning to tire from the effort and loss of blood.\n\nThen the iron warriors scream their battle cries, as they charge in their thick black armor. They've split into two groups, doing one of those 'pinching' maneuvers. Plan on using those two walls of metal to crush me flatter than a Noxian coin.\n\nDamn it.\n\nAny hope I got of surviving this, it's gone...\n\nAnd that's when I see her. The most loyal, trustworthy, honorable friend an undeserving bastard like me could ever have.\n\n[[File:Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 3.png|20px|link=]] Skaarl.\n\nRiding like hell toward me. Faster than I've ever seen her run. A rooster tail of dust is shooting up behind her. The damn lizard even picks up my hat on her way to me. I run to her just as those black-clad warriors are about to crush me.\n\nI leap into the saddle, and we circle around the iron warriors. There'll be time to kill them after we get rid of that ballista.\n\n'''''&quot;It's been a while since we took on a whole army together&quot;''''', I say.\n\n'''''&quot;Greefrglarg&quot;''''', Skaarl screeches happily.\n\n'''''&quot;Back at you, buddy&quot;''''', I say with a smile wider than a croxagor's.\n\n'Cause there ain't nothing I love more than this dang lizard.\n\n[[File:Sion promo icon.png|center|250px]]\n\n;The Reunion\n\n[[File:Kled- The Reunion|center|640px]]\n\n''&quot;Another day on the northern plains.

As was his people's way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. \n\nTrekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered in ancient runes. Though the meaning of the runes was long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. Inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren's song, captivating and seductive. \n\nWhile the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his hand...\n\n[[File:Kegan Rodhe.jpg|center|400px]]\n\nThat is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand.

Protected by a spiked shell, Rammus inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes - from [[Ascended|demigod]], to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the desert.\n== Lore ==\n\nSome believe {{ci|Rammus}} is an [[Ascended]] being, an ancient god amongst men who rolls to [[Shurima|Shurima\u2019s]] aid as an armored guardian in its times of need. Superstitious folk swear he is a harbinger of change, appearing when the land is on the verge of a great shift in power. Others speculate he is the last of a dying species that roamed the land before the Rune Wars sundered the desert with uncontrolled magic.\n\nWith so many rumors of great power, magic, and mystery surrounding him, Rammus compels many Shurimans to seek his wisdom. Soothsayers, priests, and deranged lunatics alike claim to know where Rammus dwells, but the Armordillo has proved elusive. Despite this, proof of his presence predates living memory, with crumbling mosaics depicting his image on the most ancient walls of Shuriman ruins. His likeness adorns colossal stone monuments made in the early days of Ascension, leading some to believe he is no less than an immortal demigod. Skeptics often point to a simpler explanation: that Rammus is just one of many such creatures.\n\nIt is said that he appears only to worthy pilgrims in great need of his aid, and those blessed by his presence experience great turning points. After the Armordillo rescued the heir to a vast kingdom from a terrible fire, the man renounced his position to become a goat farmer. An elderly mason was inspired by a profound, yet brief conversation with Rammus, and constructed an enormous marketplace which became the bustling heart of Nashramae.\n\nKnowing Rammus\u2019s guidance can pave an enlightened path, devout believers perform elaborate rituals designed to attract the favor of their deity. Disciples of the cult devoted to Rammus demonstrate their unwavering faith in a yearly ceremony by imitating his famous roll and somersaulting through the city in droves. Every year, thousands of Shurimans trek through the most treacherous and remote corners of the desert on a quest to find Rammus, for many teachings indicate he will answer a single question of those he finds deserving, if they are able to find him. Knowing his enthusiasm for desert treats, the pilgrims arm themselves with offerings thought to attract his blessing, packing their mules with flasks of sweet goat\u2019s milk, chests filled with colonies of ants sealed in wax, and jars of honeycombs. Many never return from the deep desert, and fewer still with stories of the demigod, though travelers describe waking to find their packs mysteriously emptied of all edible provisions.\n\nWhether he is truly a wise oracle, Ascended deity, or a mighty beast, Rammus is known for his miraculous feats of endurance. He entered the impenetrable Fortress of Siram, an imposing bastion designed by a crazed sorcerer. The structure was said to contain untold magical horrors - fearsome beasts mutated beyond recognition, corridors wreathed in flames, impenetrable tunnels guarded by shadow demons. Not an hour had passed when the enormous fortress collapsed in a plume of dust, and Rammus was seen rolling away. None knew why Rammus entered the darkened gate, nor what secrets he learned within the basalt walls of the fortress. In the year of the great flood he crossed the vast lake of Imalli in just two days, and dug many miles deep to destroy a giant anthill and kill its queen, whose daughters had devastated the nearby farmland.\n\nSometimes he appears as a benevolent hero. When invading [[Noxus|Noxian]] warbands attacked a Northern Shuriman settlement, disparate tribes banded together to defend the territory beneath the Temple of the Ascended. They were no match for the invaders in size or skill, and the battle was all but lost when Rammus entered the fray. Each side was so shocked to see the elusive creature that fighting halted completely as they watched him roll between them. As Rammus passed the towering temple, the foundations of the building shook, and enormous stone blocks toppled onto the invading army, crushing many of its warriors. Now outnumbered, the army retreated to elated cheers from the Shurimans. While many swear Rammus saved the town out of love for Shurima, others argue he was merely defending the territory in which his favorite cactus flowers grew. At least one tribesman claims Rammus was simply sleeprolling and had no intention of taking down a temple.\n\nWhatever the truth, stories of Rammus are treasured by the people of Shurima. Any Shuriman child can list a dozen theories on the question of his origin, half of which they likely invented on the spot.

All who challenge the 'Truth Bearer of Nagakabouros' soon discover Illaoi never battles alone - the god of the [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]] fights by her side.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Illaoi Relic.png|center|200px]]\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;There can be no rest. We are the motion.&quot;'' - from 'The Twenty Wisdoms of Nagakabouros'&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAll who encounter Illaoi are struck by her presence. An intense woman, the priestess is fully committed to the experience of living. She takes what she wants, destroys what she hates, and revels in everything she loves.\n\nHowever, to truly know Illaoi you must understand the religion she has devoted her life to. {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}}, the deity of her faith, is usually depicted as an enormous serpent head with tentacles spiraling around it in endless motion, with no beginning and no end. Also called The Mother Serpent, The Great Kraken, or even The Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros is the Serpent Isles' god of life, ocean storms, and motion (the literal translation of its name is 'the unending monster that drives the sea and sky') Central to the religion's theology are three tenets: every spirit was born to serve the universe; desire was built into every living being by the universe; the universe only moves toward its destiny when living creatures chase their desires.\n\nLesser priestesses are tasked with maintaining temples, calling holy serpents, and teaching people the ways of Nagakabouros. As the religion's Truth Bearer, Illaoi's role is to serve the god directly by unblocking the flow of the universe. To this end, she has two sacred responsibilities.\n\nThe first duty of a Truth Bearer is to be the spearhead in the war against [[Shadow Isles|undeath]]. Having fallen outside of the normal flow of the universe, the undead are considered an abomination against Nagakabouros. While it is the responsibility of every priestess of the Kraken to protect the indigenous population from the [[Harrowing]], a Truth Bearer directly engages its most powerful spirits and drives the Black Mist back.\n\nSecond, Illaoi is tasked with seeking out individuals of great potential and challenging them with the {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi|Test of Nagakabouros}}. This task is the burden Illaoi's title reflects. With her massive, holy relic, {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|The Eye of God}}, the Truth Bearer strips the subject's spirit from their body then forces them to {{ai|Vessel|Illaoi|stand against her}} to prove their worth. She does this knowing those who fail will be completely annihilated, for the great Kraken has no tolerance for cowardice, doubt, or restraint. But destruction is never the goal. Survivors of the ordeal are forever changed and often find the will to pursue their true destiny.\n\nThough Illaoi is the most powerful and respected Truth Bearer in a hundred generations, it is where she has broken the traditions of her faith that speaks the most about her. Having completed her training as a Truth Bearer, and at the height of her power, Illaoi left the golden temples of Buhru for the squalor of nearby [[Bilgewater]].\n\nThe pirate city is the only place foreigners are permitted on the Serpent Isles, viewed as a fetid gutter by Illaoi's people. Previous Truth Bearers ignored the city and viewed the arriving foreigners as little better than untouchables. [[Shadow and Fortune|Illaoi broke with tradition when she chose to protect residents of Bilgewater from the Harrowing]], or even more controversially when she decided that some of its residents had souls worthy of the great test. Despite this, only a handful of temples have been opened in the city, and very few ''paylangi'' (islander slang for residents of mainlander descent) have ever been permitted inside.\n\nRegardless, it is Illaoi who has brought the widespread awareness of the Mother Serpent to Bilgewater, and it is her indomitable spirit that has brought her religion into favor there.\n\nRumors persist that {{ci|Gangplank|Bilgewater's most bloodthirsty and infamous pirate}} had his heart broken by the towering priestess. To anyone who has ever met her, this is no surprise. Illaoi's rough manner belies subtle intelligence, strength, and a magnetic confidence.\n\nMany seek Illaoi's favor and welcome her to Bilgewater... yet everyone fears being tested by the Kraken's Prophet.\n\n;The Burden\n''&quot;Truth Bearer, this is why we must retreat to Buhru. We cannot save the'' paylangi''&quot;'', the Hierophant said. The heavy-set woman grinned, obviously pleased by the prospect of leaving Bilgewater.\n\n''&quot;You've mentioned that before&quot;'', {{ci|Illaoi}} said, walking around the stone table in the center of the room. She rolled her shoulders, loosening the muscles to fight off a yawn.\n\nBeside the Hierophant, an elderly serpent caller stood. He wore a vestment made from ropes. Each indigo-dyed cord had been woven to curl; their varying thicknesses and faded kraken ink gave him the illusion of being draped in rough-hewn tentacles. His face was completely covered by a black tattoo depicting the endless teeth of a leviathan's maw. ''Monks and serpent callers were always trying to look scary. It was an annoying habit of most men.''\n\n''&quot;The greatest beasts won't approach [[Bilgewater]]&quot;'', the serpent caller said with a wheeze. ''&quot;They stay out in the deep water, away from the stench of the Slaughter Docks. At best, a few half-starved younglings will heed our summons.&quot;''\n\nOnly the greatest children of {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|Nagakabouros}} were strong enough to consume the mists and defend the city from the [[Harrowing]]. The rest of the [[Blue Flame Islands|Serpent Isles]] didn't have this problem.\n\nIt was yet another reminder of the ignorance of Bilgewater's population. The mainlanders and their descendants didn't give time for fresh water to flow through and clean their docks. Instead, the ''paylangi'' settled permanent anchorages around every shore in the bay. It was so foolish. Many of the priesthood asserted it was proof the ''paylangi'' actually wanted to be consumed by the Black Mists.\n\n''&quot;Crap&quot;'', Illaoi said. If she was going to stay, she would have to find a way to defend the city without serpents. She picked at the food from one of the offering bowls around her, before selecting a mango. She needed a plan, and these two fools were useless.\n\nA loud crack interrupted her musing. A heavy, wooden door had slammed open downstairs.\n\n{{ci|Gangplank}}'s voice howled, the words were unintelligible, echoing around the stone walls.\n\n''&quot;We pulled him from the water, as you commanded&quot;'', the Hierophant smiled, adjusting the jade collar of her office. ''&quot;Perhaps it would have been better to let his energy return to Nagakabouros?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You do not judge souls.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course Truth Bearer, it is for'' Nagakabouros ''to judge&quot;'', he said, implying that Illaoi's opinion was biased.\n\nIllaoi walked between the two clerics, dwarfing the pair of them. Even for an islander, the Truth Bearer was tall. It had always been so. She was taller even than the largest Northman. As a girl, she had been self-conscious about it, always feeling like she was stumbling into people, but she had learned. ''When I move, they should know enough to get out of my way.''\n\nShe lifted the {{ai|Harsh Lesson|Illaoi|Eye of God}} from its stand. The golden idol was larger than a wine barrel and many times the weight. Her fingers tingled against its cold metal. It had been placed next to the giant roaring fire, which illuminated the room, but the Eye of God stayed forever cool and damp to the touch. Illaoi deftly shouldered its massive weight. In a dozen years, the Truth Bearer had never been more than two strides from it.\n\n''&quot;Hierophant, I remember my duties&quot;'', Illaoi said as she headed down the stairs. ''&quot;We will not be retreating to Buhru. I will stop the Harrowing here.&quot;''\n\nThe high priestess had done little but complain since arriving from Buhru, but there was some truth in her words.\n\n[[Burning Tides|When Gangplank's ship had exploded]], Illaoi's heart had jumped. It had been many years since they had laid together, many years since she had ended the relationship... but some feelings still lingered. She had loved him once... stupid, old bastard.\n\nSurrounded by tall walls of interlocking stones, the courtyard to the temple was shaped like the fanged mouth of a leviathan. The entrance looked over the blue waters of the bay far below. Illaoi stomped down the stairway toward the front gate. She assumed she would have to smack Gangplank in the mouth; he was prone to arrogance and rum. But still, it would be nice to see him.\n\nShe was unprepared for the snarling creature in her temple's entrance. She knew he had been injured, but not like this. He was limping badly and bent over from shattered ribs. He cradled what was left of his arm.\n\n{{ai|Parrrley|Gangplank|He swung a pistol}} around the room with his other arm, in a half-mad attempt to force the monks and priestesses to back away from him; oblivious to the fact that these were the very people who had pulled his drowned body from the bay only a few hours ago. Worse, his pistol was clearly empty and completely useless.\n\n''&quot;Where is Illaoi?&quot;'' he bellowed.\n\n''&quot;I'm here, Gangplank&quot;'', she answered. ''&quot;You look like crap.&quot;''\n\nHe fell to his knees.\n\n''&quot;It was {{ci|Miss Fortune}}. Had to be. Working with those two {{ci|Graves|alley}} {{ci|Twisted Fate|whores}}. They sank it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not care about your warship&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;You were always telling me to move on, to head back out to sea. I needed a boat.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You need only a canoe for the sea.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is my town!&quot;'' he screamed.\n\nThe monks and priestesses surrounding Gangplank tensed at this outburst. That Gangplank was foolish enough to make such a claim while standing in a structure thousands of years older than his city, was dangerous in itself. But a ''paylangi'' shouting at the thrice-blessed Truth Bearer in her own temple? ''Any other man would've been dumped into the sea with broken knees.''\n\n''&quot;It's my town!&quot;'' he roared again. Spittle flew from his mouth in rage.\n\n''&quot;So what are you gonna do about it?&quot;'' Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;I, I need Okao and the other chiefs' support. They'll listen to you... if you ask them. If you ask them, they'll help me.&quot;'' He lowered his head in front of her.\n\n''&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;'' Illaoi said, raising her voice this time.\n\n''&quot;What can I do?&quot;'' he said hopelessly. ''&quot;She took my ship, she took my men, she took my arm. Anything I had left... I used to get here.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Leave us&quot;'', Illaoi told the other priests as she walked toward the gate. She looked down on Gangplank. It had been ten years since she'd last seen him; drink and worry had taken his dashing looks.\n\n''&quot;There is nothing for me but this town, and without your help...&quot;'' his voice trailed off when he met her gaze. Illaoi kept her eyes as hard and unforgiving as the Kraken. She gave Gangplank nothing. The priestess of Nagakabouros could show no pity or sympathy, even if it tore at her chest. In despair, the old captain's eyes darted away from hers.\n\n''&quot;I could do that&quot;'', Illaoi said, ''&quot;and with a word, the tribes and Okao's gang would join you. But why should I?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Help me, damn it! You owe me&quot;'', he snapped like a child.\n\n''&quot;I'' owe ''you?&quot;'' Illaoi rolled the words in her mouth.\n\n''&quot;I keep up the rituals. I offer the sacrifices&quot;'', Gangplank snarled.\n\n''&quot;But clearly you did not learn the lesson. Rituals? Sacrifices? You speak of things for weak men and their weak gods. My god demands action&quot;'', Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;I suffered for this town! Bled for it. It is mine by right!&quot;''\n\nIllaoi knew what she had to do. She knew it before Gangplank had spoken. She had known years before his ship had sunk.\n\nGangplank had strayed. For too long, he had festered in the hatred and self-pity his father had beaten into him. Illaoi had ignored her duty. She had ignored it because she had loved him, once, and because she had led him down this path when she left him. He had been content as a killer, a corsair, a true pirate, and never interested in his father's title of Reaver King.\n\nHe had only set anchor in his bloody quest to become the lord of Bilgewater after they had parted ways.\n\nIllaoi felt a dampness in her eyes. His time had passed. He had been unable to move forward. To advance. To evolve. And now? Now he would not survive the {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi|Test of Nagakabouros}}. But he needed to be tested. He was here to be tested.\n\nIllaoi looked at the old pirate before her. ''Could I send him away? Trust that he still has some sliver of strength or ambition that might see him through? If I send him away, he might live, at least... ''\n\nThat was not the way of Nagakabouros. That was not the role of a Truth Bearer. This was not the place for doubts or second-guessing. If she trusted her god, she must trust her instincts. If she felt he had to be tested, then it was her god's will. ''And what fool would choose a man over a god?''\n\nGripping the Eye of God's handle tightly, Illaoi lowered the heavy gold icon from her shoulder. A familiar lightness replaced it, yet somehow she could still feel its weight there.\n\n''&quot;Please&quot;'', Gangplank begged. ''&quot;Show me some kindness, at least.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I will show you the truth&quot;'', Illaoi said, steeling her will.\n\nShe stomp-kicked Gangplank, her heel smashing into his nose with a crunch. He flew backward like a drunkard, blood pouring down his lip. He rolled over and looked up at her with furious eyes.\n\n''{{sbc|&quot;Behold!&quot;}}'' Illaoi intoned.\n\nShe reached out with her mind and called forth the energy of the Mother Serpent as she swung the giant idol forward. A glowing mist vomited from the icon's mouth and swirls of blue-green energy formed around the Mother Serpent's face, solidifying into {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God|Illaoi|ghostly tentacles}}. Touched by gold, these tendrils were as beautiful as the sunrise over water, and as horrifying as the darkest undersea abomination. More tentacles grew from the icon, replicating around the room as if born from some unknowable mathematics. Exponentially they grew larger, and somehow each one's growth seemed to hold all the promise and horror of the world.\n\n''&quot;No!&quot;'' Gangplank screamed. But the whirlwind ignored his cries as the storm of tentacles took him.\n\n''&quot;Face Nagakabouros!&quot;'' she yelled. ''&quot;Prove yourself!&quot;'' The tentacles grasped at Gangplank, then dived into his chest. He shuddered as ghostly images of his past lives shook around him.\n\nHe screamed as his soul was ripped from his body. {{ai|Vessel|Illaoi|His doppelganger}} stood unmoving before Illaoi. The spirit of Gangplank smoldered an almost blinding blue, its body crackling and flickering through his previous lives.\n\nThe mass of tentacles attacked the wounded captain. Gangplank rolled and stumbled to his feet, dodging what he could. But for each one that missed, more and more appeared. Reality twisted and churned around him. The swarm of tentacles crashed against him, pushing him down, pulling him further and further from his soul - toward oblivion.\n\nIllaoi wanted to look away. More than anything, she wanted to turn her eyes. ''It is my duty to witness his passing. He was a great man, but he has failed. The universe demands--- ''\n\nGangplank rose. Slowly, inexorably, and unrelentingly he forced his broken body to stand. He ripped himself from the mass of tentacles and advanced step by painstaking step, roaring through the agony. Bloody and exhausted, he finally stood in front of Illaoi. His eyes bulged with hate and pain, but full of purpose. With his final ounce of strength, he walked into the glowing visage of his spirit.\n\n''&quot;I will be king.&quot;''\n\nThe wind fell still. The tentacles ruptured in bursts of light. Nagakabouros was satisfied.\n\n''&quot;You are in motion&quot;'', Illaoi smiled.\n\nGangplank stood inches from his former love - glaring at her. His back arched and his chest swelled with the sweet air of resolve - he was the proud captain once more.\n\nGangplank turned and walked away from her, no less injured or limping, but his stride now held its familiar boldness.\n\n''&quot;Next time I ask for help, just say no&quot;'', Gangplank growled.\n\n''&quot;Do something about that arm&quot;'', Illaoi said.\n\n''&quot;Was nice to see you&quot;'', he said as he walked out of the temple and down the long steps toward the water below.\n\n''&quot;Stupid old bastard&quot;'', she grinned.\n\nAs the monks and hierophant returned to the antechamber, Illaoi remembered there were a thousand things she needed to do. A thousand little burdens she needed to carry. The Truth Bearer would have to meet with {{ci|Miss Fortune|Sarah Fortune}}. Illaoi suspected Nagakabouros would soon need to test the bounty hunter.\n\n''&quot;Tell Okao and the chiefs to support Gangplank&quot;'', Illaoi said to the hierophant. ''&quot;Help him retake the city.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The city is in chaos, many want his head. He won't survive the night&quot;'', the hierophant grumbled, looking at the injured captain struggling down the steps.\n\n''&quot;He is still the right man for the job&quot;'', Illaoi said as she hefted the Eye of God onto her shoulder.\n\n''We can never be certain if we're doing the right thing, or how things will happen, or when we will die. But the universe gives us our desires, and our instincts. So we must trust them.''\n\nShe began walking up the steps from the courtyard to the inner temple, the Truth Bearer's idol on her shoulder. It was a heavy burden - but Illaoi didn't mind it.\n\nShe didn't mind at all.\n\n", "id": 420}, "Corki": {"key": "Corki", "name": "Corki", "title": "the Daring Bombardier", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Corki\n|alias = The Daring Bombardier\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Hextech Shrapnel Shells|Corki|ROFL Copter}}\n* &lt;small&gt;({{ci|Urf}} {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nCorki Render.png|Current\nCorki HotRod Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Screaming Yipsnakes Member\n* Piltover Customs Co-Owner\n|faction =\n* [[File:Bandle City Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Heimerdinger\n|rivals = Tahm Kench\n|related = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;He is {{ci|Corki}} - death from above!&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWhen {{ci|Heimerdinger}} and his [[yordle]] colleagues migrated to [[Piltover]], they embraced science as a way of life, and they immediately made several groundbreaking contributions to the techmaturgical community.

Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF). Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over [[Valoran]], surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.\n\nCorki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness. Before [[the League]], he served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions which would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good {{w|dogfight}} in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality. When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement which he felt 'cut the engines and clipped the wings'. He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him.

''Have I told you how Braum got {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum|his shield}}?&quot;''\n\nThe girl shakes her head. The hearth fire snaps, holding off the wind.\n\n''&quot;Well. In the mountains above our village lived a man named Braum - &quot;''\n\n''&quot;I know that!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He mostly kept to his farm, tending his sheep and goats, but he was the kindest man anyone had ever met, and he always had a smile on his face and a laugh on his lips.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Now, one day something terrible happened: a young troll boy around your age was climbing the mountain and happened on a vault, set into the mountainside, the entrance guarded by a huge stone  door with a shard of True Ice at its center. When he opened the door, he couldn't believe his eyes: the vault was filled with gold, jewels - every kind of treasure you could imagine!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What he didn't know was that the vault was a trap. {{ci|Lissandra|The Ice Witch}} had cursed it - and as the troll boy entered, the magical door {{sbc|clanged}} shut behind him and locked him inside!

Braum had heard their cries and came striding down the mountainside. The villagers told him of the troll boy and the curse. Braum smiled, nodded, turned to the vault, and faced the door.

But the door wouldn't budge.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But he's the strongest man ever!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It was perplexing&quot;'', her grandmother agrees.

A benevolent but mysterious creature, Anivia is eternally bound to keep vigil over the Freljord through life, death, and {{ai|Rebirth|Anivia|rebirth}}.\n\nAnivia is as much a part of the Freljord as the never-ending frost. Long before mortals had ever set foot on the land's frigid tundra, she had lived countless lifetimes and died as many deaths. The beginnings and ends of her eternal cycle always heralded great change, from the calming of raging storms to the ebb and flow of ice ages. It is said that when the cryophoenix dies, an era ends; and when she is reborn, a new era begins.\n\nThough Anivia's past lifetimes have faded from her memory, she knows her purpose: she must protect the Freljord at all costs.\n\nWhen she was last reborn, Anivia witnessed the rise of a mighty and united human tribe. She guarded their lands with pride as they prospered, but such unity could not last forever. The great tribe fractured into three, and after that upheaval, Anivia watched the people of the Freljord become embroiled in battle. As she strove to calm the turmoil tearing her home apart, Anivia began to sense a greater threat: {{ci|Lissandra|an ancient evil}} growing deep within the earth. To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt. Like blood in water, darkness crept into the Freljord. With her destiny so tied to the power of the land, Anivia knew if such evil took root in her home, that same darkness would find its way into {{csl|Anivia|Blackfrost|her heart}}. She could no longer remain a mere guardian - the cryophoenix had to act.\n\nAnivia soon discovered an ally in {{ci|Ashe}}, the Frost Archer. Ashe too believed in unification as an end to the Freljord's perpetual strife, and Anivia offered the tribal leader her aid. Now, with war on the horizon, Anivia prepares to fight for peace, but she knows the inevitable truth of her destiny. One day, evil will rise from the ice, and she must destroy it - no matter the cost.\n\n", "id": 34}, "Tryndamere": {"key": "Tryndamere", "name": "Tryndamere", "title": "the Barbarian King", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Tryndamere\n|alias        = * The Barbarian King\n* King Tryndamere\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nTryndamere_Render.png|Current\nTryndamere King Render.png|Formal\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = [[Freljord]]\n|residence    = [[Freljord|Rakelstake]], [[Freljord]]\n|occupation   = * [[Freljord|King of Freljord]]\n|faction      = * [[File:Freljord_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord_Avarosan.png|15px|link=]] [[Avarosan]]\n* The Northern Barbarians\n|friends      = Ashe, Gragas, Braum \n|rivals       = Sejuani, Lissandra\n|enemies    = Aatrox\n|related      = * [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/ The Freljord]\n}}\n", "background": "[[File:Freljord_Tryndamere.png|thumb|310px]]\n\n== Lore ==\nFueled by his unbridled fury and rage, {{cbi|Tryndamere}} cuts his way through the tundra, mastering the art of battle by challenging the Freljord's greatest warriors. The wrathful barbarian seeks revenge on the one who decimated his clan and strikes down all those who stand between him and his final retribution.\n\nStruggling to survive in the harsh, frostbitten [[Freljord]], the young Tryndamere and his people warred with other tribes over the scarce resources of the land. One such battle changed his life forever. Raiders ambushed Tryndamere's clan in the dead of night, and though his warriors were able to push the first wave of attackers back, they weren't prepared for the {{ci|Aatrox|dark figure}} that next stepped forth. He wielded a cruel, living sword, and inspired an unhinged bloodlust in the invaders with his unearthly magic. Tryndamere's tribe was overrun within moments. With no hope of defeating the enigmatic being, Tryndamere threw himself at certain death. The dark figure swatted him aside, mortally wounding the young barbarian.\n\nTryndamere saw death and destruction engulf his home as his life slipped away. No one was left standing - only the screams of the dying remained. Unable to surrender to death, Tryndamere gave in fully to his wrath. His blood boiled and his anger consumed him, banishing his mortality. He staggered to his feet - barely able to take hold of his sword - steeling himself for the decisive confrontation with the shadowy being. But the dark figure did not even lift his blade, and instead gave Tryndamere a knowing smile as he withdrew into the shadows. That was the last time the barbarian ever saw his nemesis.\n\nA man robbed of his home and his people, Tryndamere wandered across the Freljord for years, vowing to forge himself into a brutal instrument of revenge. He visited all the tribes in the frozen wastes, besting each of their warriors until there were none left to challenge. In doing so, he mastered the barbarian ways of war and harnessed his anger as a force to be reckoned with.

One of [[Bilgewater]]'s most infamous bounty hunters, she built her legend upon a swathe of bullet-riddled corpses and captured ne'er-do-wells. The booming echoes of {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|her twin pistols}} in the port city's reeking wharfs and scavenger shanties are sure signs of another warrant from the Bounty Board being settled.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A2P3.png|left|150px]]\n\nLike most who rise to notoriety in the twisting, salt-encrusted labyrinth of Bilgewater, Miss Fortune has no shortage of blood on her hands. Yet, it was not always this way, for she was once known as Sarah, the beloved daughter of a renowned gun-dame who lived peacefully at her isolated island workshop. Young Sarah helped her mother in the forge, filing wheel locks, calibrating trigger pulls, or casting custom pistol shot. Her mother's skill in crafting firearms was legendary, and her bespoke handguns were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy noble. But ofttimes, they were desired by those with more meager means and darker hearts.\n\nOne who desired such a weapon was an up-and-coming reaver of Bilgewater called {{ci|Gangplank}}. Cocksure and certain of his power, he demanded Sarah's mother fashion {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|a pair of pistols}} the likes of which no other man possessed. A reluctant deal was struck, and a year later to the day, Gangplank returned for his weapons. He had donned a red scarf face-mask and had no intention of paying for the guns - he was there to take them by force.\n\nThe pistols Sarah's mother had crafted were masterpieces, twin hand cannons of pinpoint lethality and exquisite beauty. Too fine for the likes of him, declared Sarah's mother, seeing the brutish pirate that Gangplank had become. Enraged, Gangplank seized the pistols and gunned her down with her own creations before turning them on her husband and Sarah herself. Then, for spite's sake, he set the workshop ablaze and smashed both pistols on the ground, declaring that if they were too good for the likes of him, then no one would have them.\n\nSarah awoke to agony, straw-colored hair stained red with her mother's blood and bullets lodged on either side of her heart. She crawled from the burning ruins of her home with the broken remains of the two pistols clutched to her bleeding chest. Her body healed, but a part of her mind remained trapped in her mother's burning workshop, and no amount of soap could wash the vivid red from Sarah's hair \u2013 or at least, so the story is told. Waking nightmares and night terrors would forever torment her, but Sarah endured them with an all-consuming obsession with vengeance. She rebuilt her mother's pistols and learned all she could of the red-masked reaver during his rise to power, preparing for the day when she would be ready to slay him.\n\nTaking ship to Bilgewater, Sarah killed her first man within minutes of setting foot on the crooked timbers of the quayside, a drunken pirate with a gallon of Myron's Dark in his gut and a bounty on his head. Sarah shot him in his stupor and dragged his corpse to the Bounty Board, before tearing off a dozen more warrants.\n\nWithin a week, every one of them was settled, and those criminals who'd had the misfortune to be hunted by Sarah were either dead or in chains. She quickly earned a fearsome reputation in the taverns and gambling dens of Bilgewater, becoming Miss Fortune to inspire fear in those she hunted and to mask her true intent with flamboyant exploits. Gangplank would never see her coming; she would be just another bounty hunter among many in the crowded streets of Bilgewater.\n\nIn the years that followed, tales of Miss Fortune spread far and wide, each more fanciful than the last. She captured the ''Syren'' from a captain who learned the hard way what it meant to slip a hand where it wasn't wanted, drowned the master of the Silk-Knife Corsairs in a barrel of her own rum, and dragged the insane Doxy-Ripper from his lair in the belly of a half-dismembered leviathan in the slaughter docks.\n\n&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;400&quot; position=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\nMiss Fortune lore 01.jpg|Craftsmanship\nMiss Fortune lore 02.jpg|Weaponmaster\nMiss Fortune lore 03.jpg|Connection\nMiss Fortune lore 04.jpg|Confidence\nMiss Fortune lore 05.jpg|The Past\nMiss Fortune lore 06.jpg|Helplessness\nMiss Fortune lore 07.jpg|Devastation\nMiss Fortune lore 08.jpg|Unforgettable\nMiss Fortune lore 09.jpg|Death\nMiss Fortune lore 10.jpg|Life\nMiss Fortune lore 11.jpg|Lost\nMiss Fortune lore 12.jpg|Found\nMiss Fortune lore 13.jpg|Evolution\nMiss Fortune lore 14.jpg|Wreckless\nMiss Fortune lore 15.jpg|Delibrate\nMiss Fortune lore 16.jpg|Transportation\nMiss Fortune lore 17.jpg|Legend\nMiss Fortune lore 18.jpg|Imperfection\nMiss Fortune lore 19.jpg|Insanity\nMiss Fortune lore 20.jpg|Hunter\nMiss Fortune lore 21.jpg|Hunted\nMiss Fortune lore 22.jpg|Fury\nMiss Fortune lore 23.jpg|Fear\nMiss Fortune lore 24.jpg|Destruction\nMiss Fortune lore 25.jpg|Doubt\nMiss Fortune lore 26.jpg|Despair\nMiss Fortune lore 27.jpg|Refuge\nMiss Fortune lore 28.jpg|Reborn\nMiss Fortune lore 29.jpg|Confidence\nMiss Fortune lore 30.jpg|Everything\nMiss Fortune lore 31.jpg|The Target\nMiss Fortune lore 32.jpg|The Weapon\nMiss Fortune lore 34.jpg|The Duel\nMiss Fortune Captain Login Screen still.png|The Captain\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\nGangplank was still too powerful to confront openly, so Miss Fortune spent the years wisely, surrounding herself with a small but loyal cadre of allies and lovers she would eventually use to lay her demons to rest. But just killing Gangplank would never be enough for Miss Fortune. Only his abject humiliation and the burning to ash of all he cared for would satisfy the bloody-haired bounty hunter.\n\nAnd that day has come at last.\n\nMiss Fortune has risked everything to make her opening move against Gangplank. Plots within plots have seen the ''Dead Pool'' blown to flaming wreckage at the quayside and the self-professed King of Bilgewater overthrown. Best of all, everyone in Bilgewater saw him fall.\n\nNow, with Gangplank deposed, every reaver captain and ganglord in the port city is vying to take his position.\n\nThe battle for Bilgewater has begun.\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A2P3.png|left|150px]]\n\n[[Bilgewater]]'s White Wharf had earned its name thanks to the layer of bird waste covering it from end to end, which was only to be expected at a resting place for the dead. Folk here didn't bury corpses; they returned them to the sea. A grave of the sunken dead hung suspended in the cold depths, marked by hundreds of bobbing grave-buoys. Some were merely name posts, while others were elaborate tomb markers carved to resemble rearing krakens or buxom sea wenches.\n\n{{ci|Miss Fortune}} sat on an empty crate of Rapture Rum at the end of the wharf, legs crossed and a noxious cheroot dangling from her bottom lip. In one hand, she held a length of breathing tube connected to a half-submerged coffin floating low in the water. In the other, she grasped a length of frayed rope running through a rusted pulley block and tied to the coffin lid. {{ai|Impure Shots|Miss Fortune|Both her pistols}} were holstered within easy reach.\n\nMoonlight cast a weak glow through the mist rolling in from the sea, staining the water's scummed surface tobacco yellow. Cawing carrion gulls lined every swaybacked roof on the quayside, which was always a good omen. They knew better than any the signs of fresh pickings.\n\n''&quot;About time&quot;'', she whispered, as a shaven-headed man in a drake-scale frock coat emerged from the narrow, debris-choked alley. A pack of needle-toothed wharf-rats stalked him, hoping he was drunk and might pass out to become easy meat. The man's name was Jakmunt Zyglos, one of the Painted Brothers. Any corsair worth his salt had tattoos, but every inch of Zyglos was inked with clawed serpents, lovers' names, and a record of every boat he'd sunk, every man he'd murdered. His skin was as good a confession as any she'd known.\n\nHe marched purposefully along the wharf, but his eyes darting warily from side to side gave the lie to his confidence. His hand gripped a long cutlass with a shark-toothed edge that hung low on his hip. He too boasted a firearm, a stubby carbine with glassy pipes running the length of its barrel.\n\n''&quot;Where is he?&quot;'' demanded Zyglos. ''&quot;You said you'd bring him.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That a [[Piltover]] hex-carbine?&quot;'' she asked, ignoring his question.\n\n''&quot;Answer me, damn you!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You first&quot;'', said Miss Fortune, letting some rope out through the pulley and allowing the coffin to sink a little more. ''&quot;After all, I'm not sure how long this breathing tube is, and you wouldn't want your brother to go without air, would you?&quot;''\n\nZyglos took a breath, and she saw the tension go out of him.\n\n''&quot;Yes, damn you, it's from Piltover&quot;'', he said, drawing the weapon and holding it out by the trigger guard.\n\n''&quot;Pricy&quot;'' said Miss Fortune.\n\n''&quot;I guess you\u2019d know&quot;'', he sneered.\n\nShe let out even more rope. Bubbles of air escaped the now fully submerged coffin. Zyglos held up his hands, instantly contrite.\n\n''&quot;Alright! Alright!&quot;'' he pleaded. ''&quot;It's yours. Pull him up. Please.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You'll come quietly?&quot;''\n\nZyglos gave a bark of fatalistic laughter.\n\n''&quot;What choice do I have?&quot;'' he asked. ''&quot;You sank my ships and killed all my men. You've sent my kin to the poorhouse or the gaol, and for what? A stolen hex-gun? A bounty?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A little of both and then some?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;So how much am I worth to you, bitch?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Coin? Five hundred {{ai|Silver Serpents|Gangplank}}.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;All this mayhem for a lousy five hundred serpents?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's not the money that's got you killed. It's the fact that you're one of {{ci|Gangplank}}'s sworn men&quot;'', said Miss Fortune. ''&quot;That's why I want you dead.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Dead? Wait, the warrant says alive!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;True, but I've never been very good at following instructions&quot;'', said Miss Fortune, releasing the rope and the breathing tube. The coffin plunged into the darkness of the sunken dead, trailing a froth of frantic bubbles. Zyglos screamed his brother's name and ran at her, drawing his serrated sword. She let him get within spitting distance before drawing her pistols and blasting him with both barrels, one through the eye, one in the heart.\n\nMiss Fortune spat her cheroot into the sea and blew the smoke from each muzzle.\n\n''&quot;Self defense&quot;'', she said with a smile, rehearsing her lie for the bounty pursers. ''&quot;Crazy fool came at me with that fang-sword of his. I didn't have a choice.&quot;''\n\nMiss Fortune bent to retrieve the fallen hex-carbine. She turned the weapon over in her hands. Too light for her tastes, but artfully made and absurdly lethal. The ghost of a smile twitched the corner of her mouth as she thought back to the warmth of the old workshop, the smell of gun oil, and the touch of her mother's hand on her shoulder. Miss Fortune sighed and shook off the memory before it turned sour. She threw the pistol out over the water, sending it down to the dead. The sea demanded its due, after all, and she'd not lied; the weapon was worth a small fortune.\n\nShe stood and strolled back into Bilgewater. She knew she ought to throw Zyglos' corpse into the water too, but the wharf-rats and the carrion gulls had to eat, didn't they?\n\nAnd fresh meat was a rare delicacy on the White Wharf.\n\n", "id": 21}, "Yorick": {"key": "Yorick", "name": "Yorick", "title": "Shepherd of Souls", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Yorick\n|real_name = Yorick Mori\n|alias = \n* The Shepherd of Lost Souls\n* &lt;s&gt;Brother Yorick&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Last Rites|Yorick|Monk's Spade}}\n* {{ai|Shepherd of Souls|Yorick|Mist Walkers}}\n* {{ai|Mourning Mist|Yorick|The Black Mist}}\n* {{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|Maiden of the Mist}}\n|render = Yorick Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Blessed Isles\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Soul Shepherd\n* &lt;s&gt;Monk of Dusk&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Bass Guitarist for [[Pentakill (band)|Pentakill]] {{w|Alternate universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = \n|enemies = Kindred, Mordekaiser, Thresh\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/yorick?_k=8099pj Shepherd of Souls]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;These isles... how they scream.&quot;'' - {{ci|Yorick}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe last survivor of a long-forgotten religious order, Yorick is both blessed and cursed with power over the dead. Trapped on the [[Shadow Isles]], his only companions are the {{ai|Shepherd of Souls|Yorick|rotting corpses}} and {{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|shrieking spirits}} that he gathers to him. Yorick's monstrous actions belie his noble purpose: to free his home from the curse of {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|the Ruination}}.\n\n==Lore==\nEven as a child, Yorick's life was never normal. Raised in a fishing village at the very edge of the Blessed Isles, he always struggled to find acceptance. While most children his age were playing hide-and-seek, young Yorick was making friends of a different kind - the spirits of the recently deceased.\n\nAt first, Yorick was terrified of his ability to see and hear the dead. Whenever someone in the village passed away, Yorick would lie awake all night, waiting for the chilling cry of a new visitor. He could not understand why they chose to haunt him, and why his parents believed the spirits to be nothing more than nightmares.\n\nIn time, he came to realize the souls were not there to harm him. They were simply lost and needed help finding their way to the beyond. Since only Yorick was able to see these spirits, he took it upon himself to be their guide, escorting them to whatever awaited in eternity.\n\nThe task was bittersweet. Yorick found that he enjoyed the company of ghosts, but each one he brought to rest meant saying farewell to another friend. To the dead, he was a savior, but to the living, he was a pariah. The villagers only saw a disturbed little boy who spoke to people who weren't there.\n\nTales of Yorick's visions soon spread beyond his village, and drew the attention of a small order of monks who dwelled at the heart of the Blessed Isles. Its envoys traveled to Yorick's island, believing he could become an asset to their faith.\n\nYorick agreed to journey to their monastery, and there, he learned the ways of the Brethren of the Dusk and the true significance of their trappings. Every monk carried a {{ai|Last Rites|Yorick|spade}} as a symbol of their duty to conduct proper burial rites, which ensured souls would not lose their way. And each brother wore a vial of water drawn from the Blessed Isles' sacred spring. These Tears of Life represented the monks' duty to heal the living.\n\nYet, no matter how he tried, Yorick could never gain the acceptance of the other monks. To them, he was tangible proof of things that should only be known through faith. They resented his power to easily perceive what they themselves had struggled their entire lives to understand. Shunned by his brothers, Yorick found himself alone again.\n\nOne morning, as he tended to his duties in the cemetery, Yorick was interrupted by the sight of a pitch-black cloud roiling across the surface of the Blessed Isles, devouring everything in its path. Yorick tried to run, but the cloud quickly enveloped him and plunged him into shadow.\n\nAll around Yorick, living things began to writhe and contort, corrupted by the foul magic in [[the Black Mist]]. People, animals, even plants began to transform into vile, ghoulish mockeries of their former selves. Whispers emanated from the turbulent air around him, and his brothers began ripping the vials of healing water from their necks, as if the objects were causing them great anguish. A moment later, Yorick watched in abject horror as the monks' souls were ripped from their bodies, leaving cold, pale corpses behind.\n\nAmong the quieting screams of his brethren, Yorick alone could hear voices within the mist.\n\n{{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|''&quot;Remove it. Join us. We will become one.&quot;''}}\n\nHe felt his fingers grasping for the vial at his neck. Mustering all his resolve, Yorick forced his hands away from his throat and commanded the howling souls to stop. The Black Mist writhed violently, and darkness overtook him.\n\nWhen Yorick awoke, the winds had calmed, and the once-fertile lands had transformed into the grotesque hellscape of the [[Shadow Isles]]. Isolated tendrils of the Black Mist clung to him, trying to overtake the one living thing not yet corrupted. As the Mist wrapped itself around him, Yorick saw it suddenly recoil from the vial at his neck. Yorick clutched the blessed water, realizing it was all that kept him alive.\n\nIn the days that followed, Yorick scoured the islands for survivors, but found only the twisted remnants of what once lived there. Everywhere he walked, he witnessed wretched spirits rising from the bodies of the dead.\n\nAs he searched, Yorick slowly pieced together the events that led to the cataclysm: a king had arrived seeking to resurrect his queen, but instead, had doomed the Isles and everything on them.\n\nYorick wished to find this {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|'Ruined King'}} and undo the curse he had unleashed. But he felt powerless in the face of the seemingly endless death that surrounded him.\n\nAlmost lost within his grief, Yorick began to speak to the spirits around him, attempting to find solace with them as he had as a child. Instead, as he communed with the Mist, {{ai|Shepherd of Souls|Yorick|corpses}} left their {{ai|Awakening|Yorick|graves}}, guided by his voice. He realized the bodies he once laid to rest were now his to command.\n\nA glimmer of hope shone from the heart of his despair. To free the dead of the Shadow Isles, Yorick would wield their power and their strength.\n\nIn order to end the curse, he would be forced to use it.\n\n;Last Rites\n''&quot;Help... me&quot;'', begged the shipwrecked man.\n\n{{ci|Yorick}} couldn't say how long the survivor had been lying there, bones broken, bleeding into what remained of his wrecked sailing vessel. He had been moaning loudly, but his cries were drowned out by the multitude of wailing souls that haunted the isle. A maelstrom of spirits gathered around him, drawn to his flickering life force like a beacon, hungry to reap a fresh soul. The man's eyes widened in horror.\n\nHe was right to be scared. Yorick had seen what happened to lost spirits taken by the Black Mist, and this - this was warm flesh, a rarity in the [[Shadow Isles]]. It had been how long - a hundred years? - since Yorick had seen a living being? He could feel the Mist on his back quivering, eager to wrap this stranger in its cold embrace. But the sight of the man stirred something in Yorick he had long forgotten, and whatever it was would not allow him to surrender this life. The burly monk heaved the damaged man onto his shoulders and carried him back up the hill to his old monastery.\n\nYorick studied the face of the injured man as he groaned in agonized protest with each step the monk took. ''Why did you come here, live one?''\n\nAfter completing the climb, Yorick carried his guest through several corridors in the abbey, before coming to a stop in an old infirmary. He eased the shipwrecked man onto a massive stone table and began to check his vitals. Most of the man's ribs were shattered, and one of his lungs had collapsed.\n\n{{ai|Eulogy of the Isles|Yorick|''&quot;Why do you waste your time?&quot;''}} asked a chorus of voices, speaking in unison from the Mist on Yorick's back.\n\nYorick remained silent. He left the table and made his way to a heavy door in the rear of the infirmary. The door resisted as he pushed, his hand doing little but leaving a print in the thick layer of dust. He pressed his shoulder against the wood and heaved his entire weight into it.\n\n''&quot;So much effort for naught&quot;'', sneered the Mist. ''&quot;Let us have him.&quot;''\n\nAgain, Yorick answered it with contemptuous silence as he finally forced the door open. The heavy oak dragged across the stone tiles of the monastery floor, revealing a chamber full of scrolls, herbs, and poultices. For a moment, Yorick stared at the artifacts of his former life, struggling to remember how to use them. He picked up a few that looked familiar - bandages, yellow and brittle with age, and some ointment that had long turned to crust\u2014and returned to the man atop the stone table.\n\n''&quot;Just leave him&quot;'', said the Mist. ''&quot;He was ours the moment he came ashore.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Quiet!&quot;'' snapped Yorick.\n\nThe man on the table was now gasping for breath. Knowing he had little time to save him, Yorick tried to bind his wounds, but the rotten bandages fell apart as quickly as he could apply them.\n\nAs his breath grew more ragged, the man convulsed. He grabbed the monk's arm in agonized desperation. Yorick knew there was only one thing that could save the man's life. He uncorked the crystal vial at his neck, and considered the life-giving water it contained. There was precious little left. Yorick was unsure if it was enough to save the man, and even if it did...\n\nYorick was forced to face the truth. In trying to save the man, he was just chasing the memory of his former life, when this cursed place was called the Blessed Isles. The souls in the Mist had taunted him, but they'd taunted him with the truth. This man was doomed, and if Yorick used the Tears of Life, he would be too. He closed the vial and let it rest against his neck.\n\nStepping back from the table, Yorick watched the man's chest rise and fall one last time. [[The Black Mist]] filled the room, spirits clawing out from it in anticipation. The Mist shivered eagerly, then ripped the dead man's soul from his body. It uttered a faint, feeble cry before it was devoured by its new host.\n\nYorick stood motionless in the room and uttered a barely remembered prayer. He looked at the soulless husk on the table, a bitter reminder of the task he had yet to complete. While the curse of the Ruination remained, anyone who came to these isles would suffer the same fate. He had to bring peace to these cursed islands, but after years of searching, all he had found were whispers about {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|a ruined king}}.\n\nHe needed answers.\n\nWith a single motion of Yorick's hand, {{ai|Mourning Mist|Yorick|a thin strand of Mist}} poured into the man's body. A moment later, it rose from the table, barely sentient. But it could see, it could hear, and it could walk.\n\n''&quot;Help me&quot;'', said Yorick.\n\nThe body shambled out the door of the infirmary, its sloughing footsteps echoing through the halls of the monastery. It continued out into the foul air of the cemetery, walking through the rows of {{ai|Awakening|Yorick|emptied graves}}.\n\nYorick watched as the corpse trudged toward the center of the isles until it disappeared into the Mist. Perhaps this one would return with the answer.\n\n", "id": 83}, "Xerath": {"key": "Xerath", "name": "Xerath", "title": "the Magus Ascendant", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Xerath\n|real_name  = * Xerath &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Shurima|Shuriman:]] &quot;one who shares&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;\n|alias      = * The Magus Ascendant \n* Emperor Xerath\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|weapon_pet = *{{ai|Shocking Orb|Xerath|Pure Arcane energy}}\n|race       = [[Ascendant]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Corrupted Arcane form, formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Shurima|Shuriman Capital]], [[Shurima]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Ancient times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence  = [[Shurima|Nerimazeth]], [[Shurima]]\n|faction    = * Independent\n|friends    = Renekton, Cassiopeia\n|rivals     = \n|enemies    = Azir, Nasus\n|related    = \n*[[Azir/Background|Azir - Arisen]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKnM6Hh5gOg/ Shurima: Descent into the Tomb]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima Ascension]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast army]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/xerath Magus Ascendant]\n* [[Bloodline]]\n|render = [[File:Xerath Render.png|link=|270px]]}}\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;A lifetime as a slave has prepared me for eternity as your master.&quot;'' - {{ci|Xerath}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n{{ci|Xerath}} is an [[Ascendant|Ascended]] Magus of ancient [[Shurima]], a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|magical sarcophagus}}. For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nThe boy who would eventually be called Xerath was born a nameless slave in Shurima thousands of years ago. He was the son of captured scholars, with only the prospect of endless servitude ahead. His mother taught him letters and numbers, while his father told him tales from history in the hopes that such skills might allow him a better life. The boy vowed he would not end up bent-backed and whipped like every other slave.\n\nWhen the boy\u2019s father was crippled during the excavations for the foundations of a monument to the Emperor\u2019s favorite horse, he was left to die at the site of the accident. Fearing her son would suffer a similar fate, the boy\u2019s mother begged an esteemed tomb architect to take him on as an apprentice. Though at first reluctant, the architect was impressed with the boy\u2019s eye for detail and innate understanding of mathematics and language, and accepted. The boy never saw his mother again.\n\nHe was a swift learner and his master dispatched him on errands to the Great Library of {{ci|Nasus}} to retrieve specific texts and plans on an almost daily basis. On one trip, the boy met {{ci|Azir}}, the least-favored son of the emperor. Azir was struggling to read a difficult passage in an ancient text, and, despite knowing that to talk to royalty was to invite death, the boy paused to help the young prince with its complex grammar. In that moment, a tentative friendship was established, and over the coming months that friendship only grew stronger.\n\nThough slaves were forbidden names, Azir gave one to the boy. He named him Xerath, which means \u2018one who shares,\u2019 though that name was only ever spoken between the two boys. Azir saw to it that Xerath was appointed to his household\u2019s slaves, and made him his personal attendant. Their shared love of knowledge saw them devour texts from the library and become as close as brothers. Xerath was Azir\u2019s constant companion, learning all he could from this new proximity to culture, power and knowledge, finally daring to dream that Azir might one day free him.\n\nOn the annual tour of the emperor\u2019s dominion, assassins struck the royal caravan as it spent the night at a well-known oasis. Xerath saved Azir from an assassin\u2019s blade, but Azir\u2019s brothers were all slain, leaving the young prince a heartbeat away from Shurima\u2019s throne. As a slave, Xerath could expect no reward for his deed, but Azir promised that one day they would be as brothers.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination attempt, Shurima endured years of horror and fear of the emperor\u2019s retribution. Xerath knew enough of history and the workings of the Shuriman court to understand that Azir\u2019s life hung by the slenderest of threads. That he was heir to the throne meant nothing, for the emperor hated Azir for living while his more beloved sons had died. Of more immediate danger, the emperor\u2019s wife was still young enough to bear other children, and thus far she had borne many healthy sons. The odds were good that she would produce another male heir for her husband, and as soon as she did, Azir\u2019s life was forfeit.\n\nThough Azir was a scholar at heart, Xerath persuaded him that to survive, he must also learn to fight. This Azir did, and in return the young heir elevated Xerath, insisting he continue his education. Both youths excelled, and Xerath proved to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, one who took to the pursuit of knowledge with gusto. Xerath became Azir\u2019s confidant and right-hand man, a position unheard of for a mere slave. This position gave him great - and some said, undue - influence over the young prince, who came to rely on Xerath\u2019s judgement more each day.\n\nXerath bent his every effort into seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it, no matter the cost, no matter its source. He unlocked long-sealed libraries, delved into forgotten vaults and consulted with mystics entombed deep beneath the sands; all to further his knowledge and ambition, both of which grew with unchecked rapidity. Whenever the whispers around court that spoke of his delving into unsavory places grew too loud to ignore, he would find cunning means to silence them. That Azir never mentioned these whispers was, to Xerath, tacit approval of how he was keeping his emperor safe.\n\nYears passed, and Xerath took ever darker steps to keep the emperor\u2019s wife from carrying a child to term, using his nascent magical abilities to corrupt every infant in the womb. Without rivals to the throne, Azir would be safe. When rumors of a curse arose, Xerath ensured they were never spoken again, and ofttimes those who had voiced such suspicions vanished without trace. By now, Xerath\u2019s desire to escape his roots as a slave had become a burning ambition to achieve power of his own, though he justified every murderous act by telling himself he was doing it to keep his friend alive.\n\nDespite Xerath\u2019s best efforts to thwart the queen\u2019s midwives, a new prince of Shurima was brought into the world, but on the night of his birth, Xerath used his growing magical powers to summon the elemental spirits of the deep desert and craft a terrible storm. Xerath brought bolt after bolt of lightning down upon the queen\u2019s chambers, reducing it to burning rubble and killing the queen and her newborn son. The emperor rushed to his queen\u2019s chambers, only to be confronted by Xerath, his hands ablaze with arcane power. The emperor\u2019s guards attacked, but Xerath burned them and the emperor to cindered skeletons. Xerath ensured that the mages of a conquered territory were blamed for these deaths, and Azir\u2019s first act upon taking the throne was to lead a brutal campaign of retribution against its people.\n\nAzir was crowned emperor of Shurima with Xerath at his side, the boy who had once been a nameless slave. Xerath had long dreamed of this moment, and expected Azir to end slavery in Shurima before finally naming him brother. Azir did none of these things, continuing to expand his empire\u2019s borders and deflecting Xerath\u2019s overtures regarding the end of slavery. To Xerath, this was further proof of Shurima\u2019s moral bankruptcy, and he raged at Azir\u2019s breaking of his promise. Azir\u2019s face was thunderous as he reminded Xerath that he was a slave and should remember his place. Something once noble died in Xerath that day, but he bowed in supplication, outwardly accepting Azir\u2019s decision. As Azir continued his campaigns of conquest, Xerath remained at his side, but his every action was carefully designed to increase his influence over a realm he now planned to take for himself. To steal an empire was no small thing, and Xerath knew he needed more power.\n\nThe famous legend of Renekton\u2019s Ascension revealed that a mortal did not have to be chosen by the Sun Priests, that anyone could rise up. So Xerath plotted to steal the power of Ascension. No slave could ever stand upon the sun disc, so Xerath fed the Emperor\u2019s vanity, inflating his ego and filling his head with impossible visions of a world-spanning empire. But such a dream would only be possible if Azir could Ascend as the greatest heroes of Shurima had before. In time Xerath\u2019s perseverance paid off, and Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that he had earned the right to stand alongside Nasus and Renekton as an Ascended being. The Sun Priests protested, but such was Azir\u2019s hubris that he ordered them to comply on pain of torture and death.\n\nThe Day of Ascension arrived and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension with Xerath at his side. Nasus and Renekton were absent from the day\u2019s events, for Xerath had arranged a distraction for them by weakening the seal on a magical sarcophagus containing {{ci|Brand|a beast of living fire}}. When that creature finally broke its bindings, Renekton and Nasus were the only warriors capable of defeating it. Thus Xerath had stripped Azir of the only two beings who might save him from what was to come.\n\nAzir stood beneath the sun disc and in the final moment before the priests began the ritual, events took a turn Xerath had not anticipated. The emperor turned to Xerath and told him that he was now a free man. He and all Shurima\u2019s slaves were now released from their bonds of servitude. He embraced Xerath before naming him his eternal brother. Xerath was stunned. He had been given everything he desired, but the success of his plans hinged upon Azir\u2019s death and nothing was going to dissuade him from acting. Too many pieces were in motion and Xerath had already sacrificed too much to turn back now \u2013 no matter how much that part of him wanted to. The emperor\u2019s words pierced the bitterness enclosing Xerath\u2019s heart, but came decades too late. Unaware of his peril, Azir turned as the priests began the ritual and brought down the awesome power of the sun.\n\nWith a roar of anger and grief combined, Xerath blasted Azir from his place on the dais, watching through tears as his former friend burned to ash. Xerath took Azir\u2019s place and the light of the sun filled him, reshaping his flesh into that of an Ascended being. But the power of the ritual was not his to take, and the consequences of his betrayal of Azir were devastating. The unbound power of the sun all but destroyed Shurima, sundering its temples and bringing ruination upon the city. Azir\u2019s people were consumed in a terrifying conflagration as the desert rose up to claim the city. The sun disc fell and an empire built by generations of emperors was undone in a single day.\n\nEven as the city burned, Xerath held the sun priests in the grip of his magic, preventing them from ending the ritual. The energies filling him were immense, alloying with his dark sorcery to create a being of incredible power. As he drew ever more of the sun\u2019s power into his body, his mortal flesh was consumed and remade as a glowing vortex of arcane power.\n\nWith Xerath\u2019s treachery revealed, {{ci|Renekton}} and {{ci|Nasus}} rushed to the epicenter of the magical storm destroying the city. They bore with them the magical sarcophagus that had imprisoned the spirit of eternal fire. The Ascended brothers fought their way to the Dais of Ascension just as Xerath fell from the deadly radiance engulfing the city. Before the newly-Ascended Magus could react, they hurled his crackling body within the sarcophagus and sealed it once more with blessed chains and powerful sigils of binding.\n\nBut it was not enough. Xerath\u2019s power had been great as a mortal, and that power - combined with the gift of Ascension - made him all but invincible. He shattered the sarcophagus, though its shards and chains remained bound to him. Renekton and Nasus hurled themselves at Xerath, but such was his newfound strength that he fought them both to a standstill. The battle raged throughout the collapsing city, destroying what had not already sunk beneath the sands. The brothers were able to drag Xerath toward the Tomb of Emperors, the greatest mausoleum of Shurima, a vault whose locks and wards were impossible to break and which answered only to the blood of emperors. Renekton wrestled Xerath within and called upon Nasus to seal the vault behind them. Nasus did so with heavy heart, knowing it was the only way to prevent Xerath\u2019s escape. Renekton and Xerath fell into eternal darkness, and there they remained, locked in an endless battle as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed.\n\nUncounted centuries passed and, in time, even Renekton\u2019s mighty strength waned, leaving him vulnerable to Xerath\u2019s influence. With poisoned lies and illusions, Xerath twisted Renekton\u2019s mind, filling him with misplaced bitterness toward Nasus, the faithless brother who had - in Xerath\u2019s fictive narrative - abandoned him so long ago.\n\nWhen the Tomb of Emperors was finally discovered beneath the desert and broken open by Sivir and Cassiopeia, both Xerath and Renekton were freed in an explosion of sand and rubble. Sensing his brother still lived, Renekton charged from the ruins, his distorted mind leaving him little better than a savage beast. After an age lost to legend, Shurima was reborn, and as it rose majestically from the desert, Xerath felt another soul return to life beneath the sand, one he had thought long dead. Azir was also newly resurrected as one of the Ascended, and Xerath knew there could be no peace for either of them while the other yet lived.\n\nXerath sought the heart of the desert to regain his strength and understand how the world had changed in the millennia since his imprisonment. His stolen power grew with every passing moment, and he beheld a world ripe for conquest, a world brimming with mortals ready to worship at the feet of a new and terrible god.\n\nYet for all his newfound power, however far he has come from that nameless slave boy, a part of Xerath knows he is still in chains.\n\n=== Unbound ===\nThis was the moment.\n\nThe singular moment that had cost him so much, that had taken a lifetime of planning. A corrupt empire and its strutting princeling would be struck down under the blankly idiotic sun symbol they both so trusted. The key to immortality, jealously guarded and miserly offered, would be his alone, stolen in front of the entire world. A singular moment of perfect vengeance that would finally free the slave known as '''Xerath'''.\n\nThough his {{ci|Azir|master's}} helm revealed no human expression, and knowing that the lovingly etched metal could not respond in kind, '''Xerath''' smiled up at the {{ci|Azir|soulless hawk's}} face just the same, his joy genuine. A life spent in servitude, first for a mad emperor and now a vain one, endless manipulations for and against the throne, a near-damning quest for barely remembered knowledge that almost consumed him\u2014all of it led to this grotesque masquerade of [[Ascension]].\n\nThe very word when spoken aloud was an assault: We will Ascend, while you are chained to the broken stone as the sands of time swallow you all. No. Not anymore, and never again. The chosen golden lords will not be taken into the sun\u2019s embrace and made gods. A slave will do this; a simple slave, a boy who once had the misfortune to save a noble child from the sands.\n\nAnd for this sin, '''Xerath''' had been punished with a horrible, maddening promise: Freedom. Unobtainable. Forbidden. Should the thought even dart through a slave\u2019s mind, it would be punished by death, as the Ascended could gaze past flesh and bone, deep into one\u2019s very soul, to see its dim traitorous glow. And yet, there it was, spoken by the young princeling he dragged from the embrace of the mercurial mother-desert. {{ci|Azir}}, the Golden Sun, vowed that he would free his savior and new friend.\n\nA promise unkept to this day. The words of a grateful child, innocently oblivious to the impact they would have. How could {{ci|Azir}} upend thousands of years of rule? How could he fight tradition, his father, his destiny?\n\nIn the end, the young emperor would lose it all by not honoring his word.\n\nAnd so, '''Xerath''' was elevated and educated, eventually becoming {{cis|Azir}} trusted right hand\u2014but never a free man. The soured promise ate into what he was, and what he could have been. Denied a small, simple thing, the right to live his life, '''Xerath''' decided to take everything, all of the things denied to him, all of the things he deserved: the empire, [[Ascension]], and the absolute purest form of freedom possible.\n\nWith each step taken toward the offensively grandiose ''Dais of Ascension'', positioned respectfully behind his emperor and flanked by the inept sentinels who supposedly protected [[Shurima]], '''Xerath''' felt an unknown lightness he was genuinely shocked by. Was this joy? Does vengeance bring joy? The impact was almost physical.\n\nAt that very moment, the overwrought suit of golden armor that was his tormentor abruptly halted. And turned. And walked toward '''Xerath'''.\n\nCould he know? How could he possibly know? This spoiled, self-obsessed boy? This righteous, falsely benevolent emperor whose hands were just as bloody as '''Xerath's''' own? Even if he did, there was no staying the killing blow that was already in motion.\n\n'''Xerath''' had planned for every contingency. He had bribed, killed, out-maneuvered, and plotted for decades\u2014he even tricked the monstrous brothers Nasus and Renekton into staying away from the event\u2014but he had not planned for this...\n\nThe Emperor of Shurima, the Golden Sun, Beloved of Mother Desert, soon to be Ascended, took off his helmet, revealed his proud brow and smiling eyes, and turned to his oldest and most trusted friend. He spoke about the love of brothers, the love of friends, of hard fights won and others lost, of family, of future, and finally... of freedom.\n\nAt these words, the guards flanked '''Xerath''', moving in, weapons drawn.\n\nSo the princeling did know. Had '''Xerath's''' plans had been undone?\n\nBut the fools in armor were saluting. There was no menace to them, they were honoring him. They were congratulating him.\n\nOn his freedom.\n\nHis hated master had just freed him\u2014he had freed them all. No [[Shurima]]n would ever wear chains again. {{cis|Azir}} last act as a human was to unfetter his people.\n\nThe foundation-shuddering roar of the assembled masses drowned out any response '''Xerath''' could have had. {{ci|Azir}} donned his helmet and strode out onto the ''Dais'', his attendants preparing him for the godhood that would never come.\n\n'''Xerath''' stood in the shadow of the monolithic {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disk}}, knowing that an empire-destroying doom was but seconds away.\n\nToo late, friend. Too late, brother. Far too late for us all.\n|-|\nExpanded=\n=== Fall of the Empire ===\n:''The following was posted as a [[Shurima Desert#Fall of the Empire|series of images]] on the League of Legends' official Facebook page.''\nIn ancient [[Shurima]], young emperor Azir was persuaded by {{ci|Xerath}}, his magus, to attempt the fabled Ascension ritual \u2013 despite ancient warnings to do so only in times of direst threat.\n\nAzir's hubris proved disastrous. As the [[File:Shurima's Legacy.png|20px|link=]] '''Sun Disc''' focused the dawn rays into a transformative beam, Xerath betrayed Azir, shoving his emperor aside and stealing its power for himself.\n\nIn an instant, Azir was obliterated \u2013 and Xerath remade as a spectral being of pure, malevolent energy \u2013 as the city around them was swallowed whole by the desert.\n\n{{ci|Nasus}} and {{ci|Renekton}}, Ascended heroes of Shuriman legend, sensed in an instant that something had gone terribly wrong and rushed to the Sun Disc.

And, while we're on the subject, this seems like as good a time as any to introduce our latest champion. Meet Xerath, the Magus Ascendant. Previously one of the most powerful mages in Valoran, Xerath's learned the hard way just what sort of trouble accepting constraints \u2013 in this case a gigantic, enchanted sarcophagus \u2013 can get you into.&lt;br /&gt;''\n\n''Of course, even a chained Magus Ascendant is somebody you want to avoid underestimating.''\n\n=== Xerath Mechanics Preview ===\nBy '''[[Morello]]'''\n\n''Greetings Summoners!''\n\n''Xerath, the Magus Ascendant, is our newest mage-type character in League of Legends. His playstyle offers a new way to perform the mage-carry role; long range barrages and sieging.''\n\n''The cornerstone of this is in his ability Locus of Power. This makes Xerath immobile, but gives his spells massively increased range and defense penetration. This really allows him to set up and barrage an area before becoming mobile again to perform a more standard mage role.''\n\n''Using this range gameplay, Xerath has wide-area spells he can use to really saturate an area with major damage. Arcanopulse, his bread-and-butter ability, shoots a short-delay beam at the area, zapping anyone hit for significant damage. Arcane Barrage, his ultimate, allows him to launch up to three massive explosions at a long range, both doing area denial and good team damage. To protect himself, Mage Chains is a reliable single-target spell that will allow Xerath to stun an enemy if he hits him with a subsequent spell.''\n\n''Xerath is something we liken to a Howitzer or artillery piece. He should really appeal to people who enjoy very long ranges and like aiming skillshots and leading targets. We're excited to offer a new mage paradigm to League of Legends, and will be continuing to add new ways to play existing roles into the game.''\n\n== Previous Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|\nOld lore=\nIn the ancient civilization of [[Shurima Desert|Shurima]], the mage called Xerath practiced magic with undying passion. He believed that with enough magical power, he could gaze into the heart of [[Runeterra]] to know the secrets of history and the universe beyond. Such magic was beyond the limitations of a mortal body, but Xerath obsessively pursued a path to infinite power nonetheless. With every breakthrough he grew more and more powerful, yet not without consequence. Xerath's increasing arcane abilities wrought havoc on his physical form. Desperate, he undertook a dangerous ritual to transcend his dying body. The outcome would be immortality or self-destruction. Violent magic unleashed during the ritual caused devastation throughout Shurima, but when the dust settled, Xerath emerged as an ascended being of pure arcane energy.\n\nFree of flesh and bone, Xerath held nearly infinite power at his command. However, in the wake of his chaotic ritual, the mages of Shurima feared his careless disregard for life would bring ruin to the kingdom. After a terrible struggle they subdued Xerath, but they could not destroy his ascended form. Instead they trapped him within an enchanted sarcophagus and sealed him in an underground tomb. Eons passed, civilizations rose and fell, and Xerath's imprisonment was lost to memory. For centuries, Xerath's vast power tore away at the sarcophagus and weakened its spell. Finally, he willed forth a burst of magic that shattered his prison, but its core remained, containing Xerath and his power within its broken pieces. Seeking to rid himself of this burden, he was drawn to the magic of [[Valoran|Valoran's]] [[nexus]]es and found he could absorb their power. Yet the nexuses had gatekeepers: petty mages known as [[summoner]]s. Xerath knew his key to true freedom from his prison lay in gaining their trust, and he offered his power to [[the League of Legends]].\n\n{{quote|&quot;I have no need for vengeance. Time has brought ruin to the mages of Shurima and I alone remain.&quot;|'''Xerath, the Magus Ascendant'''}}\n|-|\nLeague Judgement=\n{{Scroll box|content=\nCandidate: Xerath&lt;br /&gt;Date: 4 October, 21 CLE\n\nOBSERVATION\n\nAside from the vaguely human shape within the shattered remnants of his sarcophagus, there is very little indication that the being called Xerath was ever a man. His presence is cold and unfeeling, with nothing to be read upon the iron mask one might call his face.\n\nHe does not pause to observe the hallway around him. Xerath approaches the massive doors to the Reflection Chamber and, with a sweep of his arm, they open before him.\n\nREFLECTION\n\nThe doors had only just closed behind Xerath when a sandstorm obscured his vision. Violent, stinging wind surrounded him, and he realized in horror that it began to eat away at his very form. The shattered pieces of his sarcophagus withered into wisps of sand. Worse still, Xerath felt himself grow weak. As his prison disappeared into the storm, the arcane energy that made up his form faded with it, replaced by flesh and bone.\n\nThe sands of time had turned against him. He was human again.\n\nAround him, the storm took shape in the darkness. He recognized the sandstone walls and the statues that rose from the floor to the ceiling. These regal figures clasped scepters to their chests, and their eyes, plated in gold, gazed eternally down upon those below them. He was in the Temple of the Falcon, where all the mages of Shurima practiced their craft.\n\nThe peers of Xerath's youth sparred beneath their Magi ancestors. They threw fire and ice and twisted magic into the shapes of blades, honing the arcane into weaponry. Such was the charge of mages: the greatest masters of magic would stand victorious over Shurima's conquered foes.\n\nXerath watched silently at the temple's wall, entranced by the light from their spells. Nothing whetted his thirst for understanding as the pure arcane. Its dull glow called to him, and in its depths he knew there lay a thousand secrets.\n\n&quot;Why do you not join them, Xerath?&quot;\n\nThe voice broke his focus. Tabia, one of his fellow mages, stood beside him. Her sudden appearance and the look of her smile made him stumble with his words for a moment. &quot;Ah... well... we have our differences.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are a mage of Shurima,&quot; Tabia said. She moved closer to him. &quot;We have the same path. What differences do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;The way they bend their magic,&quot; he replied, turning his gaze back to the other mages.\n\n&quot;They make weapons of it, but they don't understand. The more you force your control over it, the more you lose your true connection to the arcane.&quot;\n\n&quot;Magic is chaotic. You know the lessons. Without a mage's guiding hand, we can only hope to control what the arcane does and does not destroy.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, but if it's pure power we want...&quot; Xerath cupped his hand. In the curl of his slender fingers, a blue-violet flame sparked into existence. He knew he could shape it as he wished, but he simply let it burn.\n\nOn its own, with only the slightest prodding, the flame grew. Soon it burned fiercely in his hand, its raw power coursing through him and warming his very core.\n\n&quot;All it needs is a vessel,&quot; he said.\n\nHe turned his gaze up from the flame to see Tabia looking at him, not his magic. She smiled again, and her beauty drew his mind away from the arcane. Between them, the flame grew stronger...\n\n...and then reality blurred around him.\n\nThe temple darkened and Tabia's face faded from his view. For a moment he remembered the summoners' trick and the Institute of War, but pain drew him back into another memory.\n\nSheer, limitless power set him aflame from the inside out. Deep within, at his very core, he felt a searing agony where the fire burned too hot, threatening to burn its way to the surface, to consume and destroy him.\n\nThe arcane needed a vessel... but his frail human form could only hold so much.\n\nXerath grimaced. &quot;I will not allow this mortal body to stop me.&quot; He held out his hand. Arcane fire sprung from his fingertips, crackling with power as it formed runes that hung briefly in the air.\n\nThe burning, blinding-white magic quickly grew to a tumultuous wind around him. An ancestral statue shattered, its pieces crashing to the ground and shaking the foundation of the temple. It took all of his strength and will to hold the spell. Even then it swelled and flared, threatening to break free.\n\nBut a voice rose above the chaos. &quot;Xerath! Stop!&quot;\n\nTabia.\n\nXerath's hold over the ritual wavered as he turned towards her voice. She stood at the foot of a Magi ancestor, her dark hair a stark frame to her pale, beautiful face.\n\n&quot;You mustn't do this,&quot; she shouted, her eyes burning fearlessly. &quot;It will consume you. It is killing you already, and you would only let it do its work faster!&quot;\n\n&quot;Tabia,&quot; Xerath pleaded, his voice hoarse and trembling. &quot;Please, you don't understand...&quot;\n\nThe spiraling arcane twisted and pulsed like a storm above them. Xerath felt it slip further from his grasp.\n\n&quot;You do not need this,&quot; she said, and there was pleading in her voice, too. &quot;Stop it now, and you can heal. You can have life again. I can help you,&quot; she paused. &quot;Come home.&quot;\n\nXerath's will faltered. Perhaps she was right. He imagined himself at home, away from the Magi and the arcane forever, and all the pain it had caused him. The way it had eaten at him from within, all gone. Perhaps...\n\nTabia mouthed something, but Xerath could not hear her. The statue above her shuddered and began to collapse.\n\n&quot;Tabia! ''NO!''&quot;\n\nAt the sound of Tabia's scream, the rest of the statues and the Temple walls began to crumble with the force of Xerath's spell. He'd lost control. At its center, he covered his face with his hands, shouting her name in agony. His brief vision of home and escape from the arcane had been lost as soon as he'd found the strength to reach for it.\n\nIt was too late to stop the spell. It would consume him, too, and he trembled in terror at the prospect. All of his efforts for naught... everything he'd worked for, lost.\n\nUnless he finished the ritual.\n\nHe hesitated. Part of him wished to accept death, but a greater part still remembered what he'd set out to do\u2014to become something greater. To transcend the mortal body that held other mages back.\n\nHe had nothing left but this. Though his whole body ached with weakness, Xerath steeled himself.\n\n''I will become eternal... or I will die.''\n\nHe raised his arms and the writhing mass of magic above him again gained some semblance of form, but still it expanded, destroying the remaining Magi statues and the temple's walls. Xerath pulled the spell inward with all the strength he could muster, blocking out what he could see of the temple collapsing around him.\n\nFor a moment, in the chaos of the arcane, he could see a reflection of himself: a pale, emaciated man, aged well beyond his years.\n\nAs the spell engulfed him, Xerath's eyes were full of fear.\n\nIn an instant, the chaos subsided. Xerath was back in the Reflection Chamber, and a hooded summoner stood before him.\n\n&quot;All that power,&quot; said the summoner, &quot;And now you are a prisoner.&quot;\n\n&quot;An inconvenience,&quot; Xerath replied, his voice echoing through the chamber.&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&quot;Yet not what you envisioned when you took control of that spell. Do you have regret, Magus?&quot;\n\n&quot;I do not.&quot;\n\nThe summoner scowled. &quot;You sacrificed yourself, your people, and the woman you loved... all for power. Power you can no longer reach.&quot;\n\n&quot;As I said,&quot; Xerath continued. &quot;An inconvenience. I will be free.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why do you want to join the League, Xerath?&quot;\n\nAt this, Xerath paused. &quot;The burden of my prison was brought about because the mages of Shurima could not comprehend what it was I pursued. I will not allow my goals to be misunderstood again. Consider my work with your League, summoner, a show of good faith.&quot;\n\nThe summoner regarded him quietly for a moment before giving a curt nod. &quot;As you say. How does it feel, exposing your mind?&quot;\n\nXerath turned away. &quot;I am no longer the na\u00efve student you have exposed,&quot; he said, &quot;My previous existence means nothing.&quot;}}\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n== Previous Abilities ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|\nShow=\n''These abilities were part of Xerath's original kit, in use from his release in [[V1.0.0.126]] until his rework in [[V4.2]].''\n\n{{Ability frame|I|\n{{Ability info\n|name = Ascended Form\n|icon = Ascended Form.jpg\n|description = Xerath feeds on arcane power, becoming increasingly resilient to physical harm; granting him {{as|15% of his ability power}} as bonus [[armor]].\n}}\n", "background": "|{{Ability2\n|targeting = '''Ascended Form''' is a [[self-buff]] ability.\n|damagetype   =\n|spelleffects =\n|onhiteffects =\n|spellshield  =\n|additional =\n|video =\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Ability frame|Q|\n{{Ability info\n|name = Arcanopulse\n|icon = Arcanopulse.jpg\n|description = {{sbc|Active:}} After gathering energy for {{fd|0.5}} seconds, Xerath  fires an arcane beam that deals magic damage to all enemies in a line. \n|leveling = {{lc|Magic Damage}} {{ap|75|115|155|195|235}} {{as|(+ 60% AP)}}\n|range    = 900 (''1300 during {{ai|Locus of Power|Xerath}}'')\n|cooldown = {{ap|7|6.5|6|5.5|5}}\n|cost     = {{ap|65|70|75|80|85}}\n|costtype = mana\n}}\n|{{Ability2\n|targeting = '''Arcanopulse''' is an [[area of effect|linear area of effect]].\n|damagetype   = magic\n|spelleffects = area of effect\n|onhiteffects =\n|spellshield  = Will block the ability.\n|additional =\n* Cast times cannot be interrupted by crowd control effects.

Armed with {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|her legendary jeweled crossblade}}, she has fought and won countless battles for those who can afford her exorbitant price. Known for her fearless resolve and endless ambition, she prides herself on recovering buried treasures from the perilous tombs of Shurima - for a generous bounty. With {{ci|Azir|ancient}} {{ci|Xerath|forces}} stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir finds herself torn between conflicting destinies.\n\n==Lore==\nSivir learned firsthand the harsh lessons of desert life when her entire family was killed by marauding Kthaons, one of Shurima's most feared raider tribes. In the weeks and months after the massacre, she survived by stealing food from local markets and exploring deserted ruins in search of trinkets to sell.\n\nMost of the ruins had long since been picked clean by thieves, but Sivir excelled at unearthing treasures others had missed. With her keen eye and relentless determination, she exposed secret passageways, solved ancient puzzles to reveal hidden catacombs, and dodged perilous traps.\n\nOccasionally, she persuaded other children to help her plunder tombs that would be impossible to loot alone. Armed with no more than coils of rope and candles, the malnourished waifs would descend into the cramped tunnels beneath the ruins in search of anything worth selling.\n\nOne day, Sivir and her compatriots ventured deep into a secret tomb she swore was filled with riches beyond imagining. After many hours of exploration, they finally discovered a hidden doorway, but were crushed to find nothing more than an empty chamber. Enraged at their wasted effort, Mhyra, Sivir's oldest companion, demanded she forfeit her role as leader. Sivir refused, and a vicious fight ensued. Mhyra was larger and stronger, and quickly overpowered Sivir before pushing her off a ledge. Hours later, Sivir awoke alone in the dark. Fighting back panic, she retraced her steps, blind and feeling her way slowly back to daylight. Once she returned to her lair, she found her traitorous friend had fled, taking everything Sivir owned with her.\n\nSivir swore she would never allow herself to be betrayed again. Determined to learn to defend herself, she joined a band of sellswords led by the legendary Iha Ziharo, serving as a weapon carrier, navigator, and dogsbody for the belligerent mercenaries.\n\nFor years, Sivir slept with a dagger tucked under her blanket. She placed no trust in Ziharo's warriors, knowing their only loyalty was to coin, but she strived to learn all she could. Sivir trained to fight, practicing with staunch determination and sparring against the younger sellswords daily.\n\nSivir's unwavering dedication and swift-growing skill caught the eye of Iha Ziharo herself, who took Sivir under her wing - an honor few received. Over the years, Sivir became a formidable warrior, and as Iha's sergeant, she fought against numerous armies, raiders and warring tribes. When the wars ended and the mercenaries struggled to find paying work, Sivir led expeditions into the ruins in search of Shurima's lost treasures.\n\nEventually, Sivir tired of living in Ziharo's shadow. The domineering leader took the greatest share of the gold, and all the glory - though it was Sivir's knowledge of Shuriman tombs that brought them much of their wealth. Worse, Ziharo refused to fight for warlords whose reputations for cruelty were at odds with her martial code of honor. But to Sivir, gold was gold, no matter how bloody the hands that paid it - morals played no part in the transaction.\n\nMany of the mercenaries agreed with Sivir and plotted with her to replace Ziharo as leader. The night before their coup, Ziharo learned of the plan. Outraged, she struck first, planning to turn her blade on her former student as she slept. Sivir had expected such an attack, and defeated Ziharo in a vicious knife brawl. Nevertheless, she was surprised to find she couldn't kill her former mentor, remembering how Ziharo had taken her in when she was no more than a bitter girl with nothing to her name. Instead, she left Ziharo alone in the desert with a half-filled waterskin, a single coin and a hollow offer of good luck.\n\nSivir's warband quickly earned a fearsome reputation as warriors of renown and explorers who could find relics that had passed into legend. Desert barons, wealthy merchants and collectors of the arcane commissioned Sivir to fight their wars or recover rare, hidden treasures. Explorers willingly paid Sivir's high price for her skill in traversing dangerous territories and navigating the ancient ruins of Shurima. Ruling chieftains hired her company to defend their lands against raiding [[Noxus|Noxians]], while warlords procured their services early in their campaigns to ensure a swift victory.\n\nIn the Year of a Thousand Storms, the lord of an ancient Shuriman city known as Nashramae hired Sivir to seek {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|a unique cross-shaped blade}} he claimed was a lost heirloom. He sent his personal guards along with her to guarantee its retrieval, and after a search that lasted many months, Sivir finally located the weapon. She pried it from the sarcophagus of a long-forgotten hero buried beneath tons of collapsed rubble with a strange sense that her entire life had been leading up to this moment. The weapon shone with gold and emeralds, and though it was ancient, its edge was as sharp as if it had been forged that day.\n\nSivir was transfixed by the crossblade, feeling as if it had been waiting for her. When the captain of the Nashramae guard demanded they return to their lord with his prize, Sivir knew she could never give it up. Sivir threw the crossblade in a curved arc, and marveled as it decapitated not only the captain, but the three men behind him before returning to her hand. Never had a weapon felt so natural in her grip, so powerful to throw. She fought her way from the tomb to emerge triumphant with the Lord of Nashramae's men dead behind her.\n\nTales of Sivir's exploits and ferocity in battle were already well-known within Shurima, but as her legend grew, her reputation spread beyond even the desert lands. In Noxus, stories of her deeds reached the ears of {{ci|Cassiopeia}}, an ambitious noblewoman who desired a relic she believed was hidden in the heart of the desert. Cassiopeia had no shortage of coin, and hired Sivir as her guide to plunder the depths of the long lost capital of Shurima.\n\nThough she instinctively distrusted Cassiopeia, Sivir was not about to dismiss such a profitable expedition. As they plunged deeper into the twisting catacombs of the buried city, many of Sivir's mercenaries were killed by a slew of deadly traps, but Cassiopeia refused to turn back. After days of endless descent into darkness, Sivir and Cassiopeia finally reached a great bas-relief depicting ancient emperors and [[Ascended]] warriors with bestial heads. Most of the buried structures they had seen were shattered from millennia spent beneath the sands, but this wall was uncannily intact. Sivir felt her blood stir as she gazed at the carvings, mesmerized by a creeping sense of recognition. In that moment of inattention, her fate was sealed.\n\nTaking advantage of Sivir's distraction, Cassiopeia stepped in close and rammed a blade through her back. Sivir collapsed in agony, her lifeblood soaking into the sand. Cassiopeia pried Sivir's crossblade from her grasp as her senses dimmed like a guttering candle. As warmth faded from her body, death closed in.\n\nBut fate was not yet done with Sivir. As her lifeblood drained, her ancestor, the long-dead emperor {{ci|Azir}}, was resurrected by the echoes of royalty within her blood. He carried her body to the Oasis of the Dawn, a sacred pool once brimming with healing waters. Bone-dry for thousands of years, it now overflowed with crystal water at Azir's presence. The healing waters enveloped Sivir's body, miraculously undoing the fatal wound dealt to her by Cassiopeia.\n\nWith a labored gasp, Sivir opened her eyes, dazed and uncomprehending, as if dragged from a dream. A vaguely familiar face looked down at her with kindness, and Sivir blinked, unsure if she was alive or dead. All around her, spirals of dust whirled hundreds of feet in the air forming towering palaces, ornate temples, and expansive plazas. The ancient city of Shurima rose from its sandy grave in all its glory and splendor, crowned by {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|an enormous golden disc}} shining brighter than the noonday sun. With Azir's return, the ancient city was restored to its former majesty.\n\nSivir had grown up hearing tales of the legendary Ascended, but thought only children and fools believed in such fantasy. Surrounded by a city that, stone by stone, restored itself from nothing, and confronted by a long-dead Emperor who spoke of his enduring bloodline and vision of a reborn kingdom, Sivir was shaken to her core. Everything she had ever believed in was cast into doubt.\n\nWith his words still ringing in her ears, she retreated to her life as a mercenary, taking solace in the everyday realities of fighting for coin. She struggled to accept she might be the heir to a forgotten empire, and tried to put such thoughts out of her mind. Even if everything Azir said were true, she was sure no one could unite the disparate tribes of Shurima. The most powerful warlords could command small territories for a time with enough gold and warriors, but the land would never rally beneath a single banner, let alone bow to one man - even if he truly was an ancient emperor.\n\nAs Azir strives to reestablish his once-mighty empire, Sivir is tormented by increasing doubts as to whether she can fully return to her former life. Looming forces encroach upon her world, and for better or worse, fate has given her a second chance at life.\n\nNow she must choose her path, and forge a new legacy.\n\n;Water\nSivir's throat felt like it was coated in a layer of broken glass. The cracked flesh of her lips burned. Her eyes refused to focus. ''I've given them more than enough time to move on.''\n\nShe leaned around the edge of the boulder. The caravan was still at the spring and showing no signs of moving on.\n\n''Why did they have to be Kthaons?'' Of the many, many tribes that want her dead, the Kthaons stood out in their persistence.\n\nSivir scanned the tribesmen again, looking for any sign the caravan might climb out of the old riverbed and continue its journey. She rolled her shoulders trying to judge if her muscles were up to fighting a half-dozen men. She'd have to take them by surprise to stand a chance.\n\n''{{ci|Cassiopeia|That prissy Noxian}} got the drop on me...''\n\nSivir shook her head, trying to clear her mind. Now wasn't the time for those thoughts. ''I'm becoming scattered from the lack of water. Why didn't I bring more water?''\n\nThe city had been bursting with it. Huge streams poured from statues, all at the command of {{ci|Azir|an Ancient}}. ''He healed my wound and saved my life.'' Then he returned to rebuilding the temples around him, calling out strange words in an old dialect she could barely make sense of. Talking to himself in a dead city filled only with sand. ''I had to get out before that sorcerer decided to sink it all back beneath the dust - or that I owed him.''\n\nSwallowing brought fresh agony to Sivir's throat. She looked at the spring again, a simple puddle of brown water in the center of the caravan.\n\n''I've given them a day'', she reasoned. ''I will die, or they will die. For a few drops of water or a few slivers of gold. That is the way of the desert.''\n\n{{ai|Fleet of Foot|Sivir|Sprinting toward}} the first guard, she readied {{ai|Boomerang Blade|Sivir|her crossblade}}. ''Would there be enough time to reach him before he turned back around?'' She counted the distance. ''Fourteen strides. Twelve. Ten. He can't make a sound. Two strides.'' She jumped. Her blade sank completely through his neck, down into his shoulder.\n\nBlood erupted as she crashed down on him. Her momentum drove them behind the line of rocks on which he'd been standing. Sivir grabbed his arms. He struggled against her, refusing to accept he was already dead. The guard's blood drenched Sivir as he took a final gurgling breath. ''This man didn't need to die.''\n\nSivir thought again of {{ci|Cassiopeia}}'s blade. ''That [[Noxus|Noxian]] bitch sunk a blade in my back. I died. That should mean something.''\n\nA distant rumble sounded. ''Horses? A sandwall collapsing?'' There wasn't time to wonder what it meant. Sivir crawled across the hard stones. ''It won't take the rest of the caravan long to notice the guard's absence.'' The next target was moving high along the ridge line. She needed to hit him before he walked away from the ledge. ''The shot has to be perfect.'' She threw the crossblade.\n\nIt hit the second guard, cutting him in half. The flying blade arced upward, but as it reached its apex, it slowed before reversing its direction. As it flew back toward her, it clipped the neck of the third man. There wouldn't be time for another throw now - the blade completed its arc, flying down toward the center of the water. She only had to reach it in time. The maneuver was an old standby. She would catch the weapon and kill the three remaining men in a single, spinning somersault.\n\nBut as she ran, her feet became heavy, and it seemed impossible to draw enough air into her pained lungs. ''Thirty strides.'' She had to make the distance before the second man's body hit the ground. ''Twenty strides.'' The muscles in her legs cramped, refusing to obey her commands. ''Fifteen strides.'' She found herself sliding, stumbling. ''No. Not yet.''\n\nThen, sooner than she had expected, the second man's body completed its fall and impacted the rocks. The sound was impossible to miss.\n\nOne mistake was enough. The Kthaons were a desert people. The remaining guards had weapons drawn before she took another step.\n\nHer crossblade hit the water between the men and her. Five strides in front of them. Ten strides from her.\n\n''I could make it.'' Every reflex in Sivir's body willed her forward. Instead, she slid to a halt, nearly falling forward.\n\n''Failing to bring enough water. Waiting too long to attack. Misjudging distances. I don't make these mistakes. Why?'' Some other part of Sivir's mind answered. She remembered the moment after Cassiopeia's dagger had pierced her back - she couldn't feel the blade itself. Instead, she felt a sudden, unexpected weight that seemed to steal her breath and crush her lungs.\n\n''&quot;I killed three of you before you heard me&quot;'', Sivir coughed.\n\n''&quot;You don't have a weapon&quot;'', the largest of the Kthaons said.\n\n''&quot;Only because I didn't want your blood in the water&quot;'', she lied.\n\nThe three remaining men exchanged glances. ''They've recognized me.''\n\n''&quot;A year ago, I killed your chieftain and two dozen of your finest for a bag of thin gold. It was a cheap price for their lives.&quot;'' She met the three men's eyes. They were spreading out from the water, attempting to flank her.\n\n''&quot;The gold I earned from killing your chieftain and kinsmen?&quot;'' she asked. ''&quot;I gambled it away in a single evening.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We will avenge them and your insult&quot;'', the largest man responded.\n\n''&quot;I shouldn't have killed them&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;not for that gold. Don't make me kill you for a few cups of water.&quot;''\n\nThe Kthaons' leader nervously adjusted the grip on his weapon.\n\n''&quot;I'm telling you I can make it to the blade before you can act&quot;'', Sivir explained. ''&quot;And if I run for my blade. You will die.&quot;'' She indicated the foul brown water. ''&quot;Your lives are worth more than that.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then we will die with honor&quot;'', the largest man decided, though his fellows seemed less certain.\n\n''&quot;Did I need that weapon to kill the twenty men you want to avenge?&quot;'' Sivir warned. ''&quot;You are too few.&quot;''\n\nThe three men hesitated. They knew Sivir's reputation. The other two pulled the largest man away, before backing to their mounts.\n\nSivir edged toward the water.\n\n''&quot;We will return with our tribesmen for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Lots of people have tried that&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;Never worked out for them.&quot;''\n\nSivir rolled her swollen tongue against the top of her mouth, desperate for relief. Every part of her wanted to kneel down to the water and drink. ''I have to wait until they cross the far dune.''\n\nAs the men climbed into their saddles and rode away, the strange rumbling sounded again. It was loud and growing louder. ''It's not horses or shifting sands.'' Sivir turned to its source and watched as a three-foot wall of blue water rushed down the ancient riverbed. ''The water from the city.''\n\nThe moment before the water hit Sivir, she felt the rush of cold, damp air in front of the flood. It shocked her like an unexpected kiss.\n\nThe first wave nearly took out her knees. The impact stung with cold, but as it enveloped her waist and legs, it became soothingly cool. Sivir laid in the water, letting it wash over her. She could feel the painful grit of the desert washing away as her hair floated weightless and free.\n\n''I was dead. I must make that mean something.''\n\n", "id": 15}, "Riven": {"key": "Riven", "name": "Riven", "title": "the Exile", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Riven\n|alias      = * The Exile\n|weapon_pet = * {{ai|Blade of the Exile|Riven}}\n|render     = [[File:Riven Render.png|link=|240px]]\n|gender     = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race       = Human\n|birthplace = [[Noxus]]\n|residence  = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--[[The Institute of War]]---&gt;\n|occupation = * Wanderer \n* &lt;s&gt;[[Noxus|Noxian]] soldier&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Member of the Crimson Elite{{w|Alternate history|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction    = * Independent \n* &lt;small&gt;(Crimson Elite{{w|Alternate history|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies     = \n|friends    = \n|rivals     = Yasuo, Varus\n|enemies    = Singed\n|related    = [[Arcade]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n\n''{{quote|&quot;There is a place between war and murder&lt;br /&gt;in which our demons lurk.&quot;|Excerpted from the poem}} ''\n\nIn Noxus, any citizen may rise to power regardless of race, gender, or social standing - strength is all that matters. It was with committed faith in this ideal that Riven strove to greatness. She showed early potential as a soldier, forcing herself to master the weight of a long sword when she was barely its height. She was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. \n\nRiven became a leader amongst her peers, poster child of the Noxian spirit. So exceptional was her passion that the High Command recognized her with a black stone rune sword forged and enchanted with Noxian sorcery. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad - perfectly suited to her tastes. Soon after, she was deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion.\n\nWhat began as war quickly became extermination. Noxian soldiers followed the terrifying Zaunite war machines across fields of death. It wasn't the glorious combat for which Riven trained. She carried out the orders of her superiors, terminating the remnants of a beaten and fractured enemy with extreme prejudice.\n\nAs the invasion continued, it became clear that the Ionian society would not be reformed, merely eliminated. During one bitter engagement, Riven's unit became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the enemy closed in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by {{ci|Singed}}. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate.

Though '''Orianna''' had incredible talent for dancing, she was deeply fascinated by the [[champions]] of [[the League of Legends]]. This fascination compelled her to begin training to become such a champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered, wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous chances which ultimately led to her tragic demise. '''Orianna's''' death shattered Corin, driving him into deep depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand the void his daughter's death left in his life, so he decided to build a replacement \u2013 one that would complete '''Orianna's''' dream of joining the League. What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his daughter. Knowing that she was destined to be a champion and seeing the way the times were changing, he created {{ai|The Ball|Orianna}} as her pet and protector. This nearly symbiotic creation uses a different type of techmaturgy, relying more heavily on electricity than clockwork.\n\n{{cbi|Orianna}} and '''The Ball''' now fight as [[Champion]]s in the League of Legends, using her sometimes misguided morality as a compass.

He takes grim pleasure in the ever-increasing rewards posted for his head, and makes sure to nail them to the Bounty Board in [[Bilgewater]] for all to see whenever he returns to port, his ships heavy with loot.\n\nIn recent times, Gangplank has been brought down by the machinations of the bounty hunter {{ci|Miss Fortune}}. His ship was destroyed with all of Bilgewater watching, killing his crew and shattering his aura of invincibility. Now that they have seen he is vulnerable, the gangs of Bilgewater have risen up, fighting amongst themselves to claim dominion over the port city.\n\nDespite receiving horrific injuries in the explosion, Gangplank survived. Sporting a multitude of fresh scars, and with {{ii|Dead Man's Plate|a newly crafted metal arm}} to replace his amputated limb, he is now determined to rebuild his strength, reclaim what he sees as rightfully his - and to ruthlessly punish all those who turned against him.\n\n[[File:Bilgewater The Dead Pool.jpg|center|550px]]\n\nThe massive [[Noxus|Noxian]] war captain shuddered and dropped his axe as {{ci|Gangplank}} rammed {{ai|Trial by Fire|Gangplank|his cutlass}} deep into the man's gut.

He collapsed in a clatter of heavy armor, his blood mingling with the seawater sloshing across the war galley's foredeck. The black-painted hull of Gangplank's ship loomed above, the two vessels locked together with boarding grapples and lines.\n\nGangplank's black and gold teeth gritted in suppressed pain - the Noxian had almost bested him. Nevertheless, he refused to let his crew see his weakness, forcing his lips into a wicked smile.\n\nWind and rain whipping at him, he turned to survey the rest of the Noxians.

Just a yordle with a hammer.&quot;'' - {{ci|Poppy}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nRuneterra has no shortage of valiant champions, but few are as tenacious as {{ci|Poppy}}. Bearing a hammer twice the length of her body, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching for the ''Hero of Demacia,'' a fabled warrior said to be the rightful wielder of her weapon.\n\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nAs legend describes it, this hero is the only person who can unlock the full power of the hammer and lead Demacia to true greatness. Though Poppy has searched the furthest corners of the kingdom for this legendary fighter, her quest has proven fruitless. Each time she has attempted to pass the hammer on to a potential hero, the results have been disastrous, often ending in the warrior\u2019s death. Most people would have abandoned the task long ago, but most people do not possess the pluck and resolve of this indomitable heroine.\n\nPoppy was once a very different yordle. For as long as she could remember, she had been in search of a purpose. Feeling alienated by the chaotic whimsy of other yordles, she preferred to soak up stability and structure where she could find it. This drive brought her to the human settlements of western Valoran, where she gazed in wonder at the caravans striping the countryside in an endless file. Many of the people there looked tattered and weary, but they stumbled on in pursuit of some ephemeral better life that might lie just beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, however, a different sort of caravan passed through. Unlike the other travelers, these people seemed to move with purpose. They all awoke at exactly the same time each morning, roused by the sound of a watchman\u2019s horn. They took their meals together every day at the same hour, always finishing within a few minutes. They set up their camps and took them down with remarkable efficiency.\n\nWhile yordles used their innate magic to fashion extraordinary things, these humans achieved equally astounding feats through coordination and discipline. They acted in concert like the cogs of a gear, becoming something much larger and stronger than any single person could ever be. To Poppy, that was more marvelous than all the magic in the world.\n\nAs Poppy watched the camp from the safety of her hiding place, her eyes caught the gleam of armor emerging from a tent. It was the group\u2019s commanding officer, wearing a brigandine of gleaming steel plates, each piece overlapping, each an integral part of the whole. The man\u2019s name was Orlon, and his presence seemed to stir the souls of everyone there. If someone became discouraged, he was there to remind them of why they pressed on. If someone collapsed from exhaustion, he inspired them to get up. It reminded Poppy of certain yordle charms, though again, without magic.\n\nPoppy crept in for a closer look. She found herself following this shining commander, as if drawn to him by fate itself. She observed Orlon as he led his soldiers in training exercises. He was not a large fellow, yet he swung his massive battle hammer with surprising alacrity. At night, Poppy listened intently to his hushed discussions with the elders of the camp. She heard them making plans to pull up stakes and head west to build a permanent settlement.\n\nPoppy\u2019s mind was overwhelmed with questions. Where was Orlon going? Where did he come from? How did he assemble this meticulous band of travelers, and was there a place for a yordle in it? At that moment, she made the most important decision in her life: For the first time ever, she would reveal herself to a human, as this was the first time she\u2019d ever felt a connection with one.\n\nThe introduction was a jarring one, with Orlon having just as many questions for Poppy as she had for him, but the two soon became inseparable. He became a mentor to her, and she a devotee to his cause. In the training grounds, Poppy was an invaluable sparring partner\u2013the only member of Orlon\u2019s battalion who was unafraid to strike him. She was never obsequious, questioning his decisions with an almost childlike innocence, as though she didn\u2019t know she was supposed to meekly follow orders. She accompanied him to the site of the new settlement\u2013an ambitious new nation called Demacia, where all were welcome, regardless of station or background, so long as they contributed to the good of the whole.\n\nOrlon became a beloved figure throughout the kingdom. Though few had actually seen him wield his hammer, he always bore it on his back, and the weapon quickly became a revered icon for the fledgling nation. People whispered that it had the power to level mountains and tear the earth itself asunder.\n\nOrlon passed the hammer to Poppy on his deathbed, and with it, his hope of an enduring kingdom. It was only then that Orlon told her the story of his weapon\u2019s creation, and how it was never truly intended for his hands. He explained to Poppy that the hammer was meant to go to the Hero of Demacia\u2013the only one who could keep Demacia whole. As her friend drew his last breath, Poppy swore to him that she would find this hero and place the weapon in his hands.\nBut what Poppy possesses in resolve, she lacks in ego, as it never even occurred to her that she might be the hero Orlon described.\n\n", "id": 78}, "Karthus": {"key": "Karthus", "name": "Karthus", "title": "the Deathsinger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Karthus\n|alias = The Deathsinger\n|render = Karthus Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Lich &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Death Worshipper\n* Death Preacher\n* &lt;small&gt;(Singer for [[Pentakill (band)|Pentakill]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Mordekaiser, Thresh\n|rivals = Soraka\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/karthus?_k=hds01n Deathsinger]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Death is not the end of the journey, it is just the beginning... &quot;'' - {{ci|Karthus}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance. The living fear the eternity of undeath, but Karthus sees only beauty and purity in its embrace, a perfect union of life and death. When Karthus emerges from the Shadow Isles, it is to bring the joy of death to mortals as an apostle of the unliving.\n\n==Lore==\nKarthus was born into abject poverty in the sprawl of dwellings built beyond the walls of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] capital. His mother died at the moment of his birth, leaving his father to raise him and his three sisters alone. They shared a crumbling, rat-infested almshouse with scores of other families, subsisting on a diet of rainwater and vermin. Of all the children, Karthus was the best ratter, and regularly brought gnawed corpses for the cook-pot.\n\nDeath was commonplace in the slums of Noxus, and many mornings began with the wailing of bereaved parents who woke to discover their child cold and lifeless beside them. Karthus learned to love these laments, and would watch, fascinated, as the tally-men of {{ci|Kindred}} notched their staffs and bore the bodies from the almshouse. At night the young Karthus would sneak through the cramped rooms, seeking those whose lives hung by a thread, hoping to witness the moment their soul passed from life to death. For years, his nightly travels were fruitless, as it was impossible to predict exactly when a person would die. He was denied witnessing the moment of death until it reached his own family.\n\nOutbreaks of disease were frequent in such cramped confines, and when Karthus' sisters sickened with the plague, he watched over them intently. While his father drowned his grief, Karthus was the ever dutiful brother, caring for his sisters as the disease consumed them. He watched each of them as they died, and a sublime connection seemed to reach into him as the light faded from their eyes - a yearning to see what lay beyond death and unlock the secrets of eternity. When the tally-men came for the bodies, Karthus followed them back to their temple, asking them question after question about their order and the workings of death. Could a person exist at the moment where life ends, but before death begins? If such a liminal moment could be understood and held, might the wisdom of life be combined with the clarity of death?\n\nThe tally-men quickly recognized Karthus' suitability for their order and he was inducted into their ranks, first as a digger of graves and pyre-builder, before ascending to the rank of corpse collector. Karthus guided his bone-cart around the streets of Noxus to gather the dead every day. His dirges quickly became known throughout Noxus, mournful laments that spoke to the beauty of death and the hope that what lay beyond was something to be embraced. Many a grieving family took solace in his songs, finding a measure of peace in his heartfelt elegies. Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple itself, tending to the sick in their final moments, watching as whatever death had laid its claim upon them took its due. Karthus would speak to each person laid before him, ushering their souls into death, in search of further wisdom in their fading eyes.\n\nEventually, Karthus reached the conclusion that he could learn no more from mortals, that only the dead themselves could answer his questions. None of the dying souls could tell of what lay beyond, but whispered rumors and tales told to frighten children echoed of a place where death was not the end - The [[Shadow Isles]].\n\nKarthus emptied the temple's coffers and bought passage to [[Bilgewater]], a city plagued by [[The Black Mist|a strange black mist]] said to draw souls to a cursed island far out at sea. No captain was willing to take Karthus to the Shadow Isles, but eventually he came upon a rum-sodden fisherman with a mountain of debts and nothing to lose. The boat plied the ocean for many days and nights, until a storm drove them onto the rocks of an island that appeared on no charts. A black mist rolled out from a haunted landscape of gnarled trees and tumbled ruins. The fisherman freed his boat and turned its prow in terror for Bilgewater, but Karthus leapt into the sea and waded ashore. Steadying himself with his notched tally-staff, he proudly sang the lament he had prepared for the moment of his own death, and his words were carried on a cold wind to the heart of the island.\n\nThe black mist flowed through Karthus, ravaging his flesh and spirit with ancient sorcery, but such was the force of his desire to transcend mortality that it did not destroy him. Instead, it remade him, and Karthus was born anew in the waters of the island as a fleshless revenant.\n\nRevelation filled Karthus as he became what he always believed he should have been; a being poised at the threshold of death and life. The beauty of this eternal moment filled him with wonder as the wretched spirits of the island rose to behold his transformation, drawn to his passion like predators scenting blood in the ocean. Finally, Karthus was where he belonged, surrounded by those who truly understood the boon undeath truly was. Filled with righteous zeal, he knew he had to return to [[Valoran]] and share his gift with the living, to free them from petty mortal concerns.\n\nKarthus turned and the Black Mist bore him over the waves to the fisherman's boat. The man fell to his knees before Karthus, begging for his life, and Karthus granted him the blessing of death, ending his mortal suffering and raising him up as an immortal spirit as he sang his lament for passing souls. The fisherman was the first of many such souls Karthus would free, and soon the Deathsinger would command a legion of unliving wraiths. To Karthus' awakened senses, the Shadow Isles was in a state of apathetic limbo, where the blessings of death were squandered. He would galvanize the dead in a crusade to bring the beauty of oblivion to the living, to end the suffering of mortality and usher in a glorious age of undeath.\n\nKarthus has become the emissary of the Shadow Isles, the herald of oblivion whose laments are paeans to the glory of death. His legions of unbound souls join with his funereal dirges, their haunting song reaching beyond the Black Mist to be heard on cold nights over graveyards and charnel houses all across Valoran.\n\n;Burial at Sea\nThe sea was mirror-smooth and dark. A pirate's moon hung low on the horizon as it had for the last six nights. Not so much as a whisper of wind stirred the air, only that damned dirge carried from who knew where. Vionax had sailed the oceans around [[Noxus]] long enough to know that seas like this only ever presaged ill-fortune. She stood on the Darkwill's foredeck, training her spyglass on the far ocean, searching for anything she could use to plot their position.\n\n''&quot;Nothing but sea in all directions&quot;'', she said to the night. ''&quot;No land in sight and no stars I recognize. Our sails are empty of wind. The oar decks have rowed for days, but no matter which way we turn, land never comes and the moon neither waxes nor wanes.&quot;''\n\nShe took a moment to rub the heels of her palms against her face. Thirst and hunger growled in her belly and the constant darkness had made it impossible to accurately gauge the passage of time. The Darkwill wasn't even her ship. She'd been it's first mate until a [[Freljord]]ian reaver's axe had split Captain Mettok's skull and given her a sudden promotion. The captain and fifteen other Noxian warriors were laid within sewn-up hammocks on the main deck. The growing stench rising from the bodies was the only consistent measure of time's passing.\n\nShe lifted her gaze to the open ocean and her eyes widened as she saw thick black mist rising from the water. Shapes moved in the mist, lambent suggestions of clawed arms and gaping mouths. That damned dirge rang out over the water again, louder now and accompanied by the dolorous peals of a funeral bell.\n\n''&quot;[[The Black Mist]]&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;All hands on deck!&quot;''\n\nShe turned and vaulted down to the main deck, running for the quarterdeck and the ship's wheel. Not that she could do anything to move the ship, but she'd be damned if she'd be found anywhere else. A haunting lament for lost souls drifted over the ship as men stumbled from below decks, and even as terror shivered her spine, Vionax couldn't deny the poetry in the sound. Tears pricked her eyes and ran down her cheeks, not in fear, but from infinite sadness.\n\n''&quot;Let me end your grief.&quot;''\n\nThe voice in her head was cold and lifeless, the voice of a dead man. It conjured the image of iron-rimmed wheels on a corpse-heaped cart, a knife cutting yet another death mark on a staff. Vionax knew the tales of the Black Mist; she knew to avoid the islands brooding beneath the darkness in the east. She'd thought the ship was far from the [[Shadow Isles]], but she was wrong.\n\nShe pulled up short as black mist boiled up over the gunwale, bringing with it howls and screeches of dead things. Wraiths spun overhead, a swirling chorus of the damned, and the Darkwill's crew cried out in terror at the sight of them. Vionax drew her pistol and cocked the hammer as a figure loomed from the mist; towering and wide-shouldered, robed in tattered vestments like an ancient prelate, yet his shoulders and gaunt skull were armored as a warrior. A chained book hung at his waist and he carried a long staff with its haft notched by countless tally-marks. Spectral light shone at its tip and burned like a fallen star in the palm of his free hand.\n\n''&quot;Why do you cry?&quot;'' said the creature. ''&quot;I am {{ci|Karthus}}, and I bring you a great gift.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I don't want your gift&quot;'', said Vionax, pulling the trigger. Her pistol boomed and fire exploded from the barrel. The shot struck the monstrous wraith, but passed through it without harm.\n\n''&quot;You mortals&quot;'', said Karthus, shaking his helmeted head. ''&quot;You fear what you do not understand and would turn away from a boon that is freely offered.&quot;''\n\nThe monster drifted closer, and the dark radiance of his staff bathed the ship's deck in pale, sickly light. Vionax backed away from the wraith's chill as her crew fell before the light, their souls drifting like steam from their bodies. Her heel caught on one of the laid out hammocks and she tripped, falling backwards onto her haunches. She pushed herself away from Karthus, scrambling over the bodies of her fellow sailors.\n\nThe hammock beneath her moved.\n\nThey were all moving, squirming and writhing like fresh-caught fish gasping for air at the bottom of a boat. Tendrils of mist rose from tears in the canvas and between the rough stitches the ship's sailmaker had used to sew them shut. Faces moved in the mist, faces she'd sailed with for years, men and women she'd fought beside.\n\nThe wraith towered over her and the dead crew of the Darkwill stood beside him, their spirit forms limned in moonlight.\n\n''&quot;Death is nothing to be feared, Mistress Vionax&quot;'', said Karthus. ''&quot;It will free you from all your pain. It will lift your eyes from your mundane existence and show you the glory of life eternal. Embrace the beauty and wonder of death. Let go of your mortality. You do not need it.&quot;''\n\nHe held his hand out and the light there swelled to envelop her. She screamed as it pressed through her skin, into muscle, through bone, down to her very soul. The wraith {{ai|Lay Waste|Karthus|clenched his fist}} and Vionax cried out as she felt herself being unwoven from the inside out.\n\n''&quot;Let your soul fly free&quot;'', said Karthus, turning to carve another notch in his staff with a sharpened nail. ''&quot;You shall feel no pain, no fear, no desire to feel anything but the beauty of what I have to show you. Miracles and wonders await, mortal. Why would you not crave such rapture... ?&quot;''\n\n''No&quot;'', she said with her last breath. ''&quot;I don't want to see.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is already done&quot;'', said Karthus.\n\n", "id": 30}, "Jayce": {"key": "Jayce", "name": "Jayce", "title": "the Defender of Tomorrow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jayce\n|render = Jayce Render.png\n|alias = The Defender of Tomorrow\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Transform: Mercury Hammer|Jayce|Mercury Hammer}}\n* {{ai|Transform: Mercury Cannon|Jayce|Mercury Cannon}}\n* {{ai|Hextech Capacitor|Jayce}}\n* {{ai|Acceleration Gate|Jayce}}\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Inventor\n* [[Piltover]]'s Defender\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n* &lt;small&gt;(The Resistance {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Caitlyn, Ezreal, Vi\n|rivals = Viktor\n|enemies = Jinx\n|related = [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Trust me: if we're smart, [[Piltover]] can stand strong against any threat.

Eager to make a name for himself, he began developing a device to harness its power.\n\nWord of the crystal's potential reached beyond the borders of Piltover. {{ci|Viktor}}, the machine-augmented scientist from [[Zaun]], brought Jayce an offer - together, they could use the crystal to advance his {{ai|Glorious Evolution|Viktor|'glorious evolution'}}, a vision of humanity fused with technology.\n\nJayce refused, but the Zaunite had no intention of leaving empty handed.

However, he soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\nOver time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity. As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem's creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth. In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.\n\nBacked by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity. A unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in.

There is nothing he can't beat into submission and bend to his will, not even the ice itself. With his massive, frozen club, he chills his enemies to the core and runs them through with jagged shards of ice. Fiercely territorial, Trundle chases down anyone foolish enough to enter his domain and laughs as they bleed into the [[Freljord|tundra]].\n\nTrundle's warband once followed a foolish and cowardly chieftain. Under such a weak leader, Trundle feared he and his kin would fall prey to the other troll hordes scattered across the tundra. When his challenge to the chieftain ended in humiliation, Trundle did something that wasn't very troll-like: instead of his fist, he turned to his wits. Thinking on his hairy feet, he spun a tall tale about the troll leaders of old, claiming they wielded weapons of great power as symbols of their right to rule. Though he'd made up the story on the spot, Trundle wagered that if he could find or steal such a weapon, he would become the rightful leader of the warband. The trolls believed him, but none thought him capable of undertaking such a challenge. Knowing the boastful troll would die trying, the foolish chieftain agreed and Trundle departed to the familiar sound of laughter.\n\nAlone but undaunted, Trundle ventured into the foreboding realm of the dreaded {{ci|Lissandra|Ice Witch}}. There, hidden among the many ancient and dangerous secrets, he hoped to find a weapon to prove his elaborate tale. He out-muscled the Ice Witch's guards and outsmarted her dark magic traps, but nothing he scavenged matched the power he'd described to his kin. Finally, he found an unexpected prize: a huge and magical club of never-melting True Ice. Grasping the weapon, he marveled at the cold power that ran through him. But then the wrathful Ice Witch herself appeared. As she summoned her dark magic, Trundle believed he had met his end, but another clever idea struck him. With a knowing grin, he offered the Ice Witch a devious proposition: a troll army, he told her, would be of much more use to her than one troll corpse...\n\nWhen Trundle returned to the warband, his fellow trolls bowed to his conquest. Calling his weapon &quot;Boneshiver,&quot; he took a moment to enjoy the look of numb shock on his chieftain's face before he caved it in. Seizing command, Trundle announced that there would no longer be chieftains - only a Troll King before whom all of his kind would kneel. The trolls rallied behind their brash, new leader and prepared for the coming war.

Where others succumbed to the harshness of the [[Freljord]], she was tempered by it until pain became power, hunger an encouragement, and frost an ally in culling the weak. Through her ordeals, she learned that to thrive in the endless winter, one must become just as cold and unforgiving. In Sejuani's eyes, her followers either have the mettle to endure or the right to die. Once she has conquered the Freljord, she knows that those who survive will form a nation to be feared.\n\nAs a child, the leader of the Winter's Claw watched her tribe's numbers slowly dwindle. Cold and starvation took all but the most resilient. She was the only one of her siblings to survive to her tenth year, leaving Sejuani sure that she too would die in misery. In desperation, she sought spiritual counsel from her tribe's mystic. But the seer did not foretell Sejuani's death. Instead, she prophesized that Sejuani would one day conquer and unite the divided tribes of the Freljord.\n\nArmored with absolute faith in her destiny, Sejuani pushed herself to extremes that would have killed anyone without her will to endure. She walked into blizzards without food or furs and trained while frigid winds raked her flesh. She clashed with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs gave out beneath her. When she assumed leadership of her tribe, Sejuani commanded her warriors to follow her example. Under her rule, the tribe grew stronger than they had ever been.\n\nIn the end, it was an offer of peace - rather than an act of war - that began Sejuani's campaign of conquest. On the first day of winter, envoys from {{cis|Ashe}} tribe approached Sejuani's camp bearing a gift of Avarosan grain. Ashe's intent was clear: if Sejuani united with her tribe, the Winter's Claw would never go hungry again. To Sejuani, the gift was an insult. In Ashe's tribe, she saw men and women, slight and soft, who preferred to farm instead of fight. Her contempt for them was absolute.\n\nSejuani gathered her people and set the grain alight. She proclaimed that Ashe's offer of charity would bring only weakness. Stripping the envoys of their supplies, Sejuani sent them back with a message: the Winter's Claw would prove to the Avarosan that only the strong deserve to survive in the Freljord. As the grain burned behind them, Sejuani rode out with her warband to inflict the first of many painful lessons to come.\n\n{{quote|&quot;I was cut from the ice, shaped in the storms, hardened in the cold.&quot;|'''{{cbi|Sejuani}}'''}}\n\n[[File:Freljord_Sejuani.png|thumb|300px]]\n{{quote|&quot;They plead for mercy when they hear our drums, but the wolf owes no consideration to the prey.

Tough, strong-willed, and above all relentless, through his life of crime he has amassed (then invariably lost) a small fortune.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P2.png|left|150px]]\n\nRaised in the wharf alleys of [[Bilgewater]], Malcolm quickly learned how to fight and how to steal, skills that have served him very well over the years. Smuggling himself to the mainland in the bilge of an outgoing cargo ship as a youth, he stole, lied, and gambled his way from place to place. But it was across the table of a high-stakes card game that Malcolm met the man who would change his life: the trickster now known as {{ci|Twisted Fate}}. Both men saw the same reckless love of danger and adventure in the other, and a dysfunctional partnership that lasted nearly a decade was born.\n\nCombining their unique skills, Graves and Twisted Fate were an effective team, pulling off scores of heists. They stole from and swindled the rich and foolish for cash, fame, and the sheer thrill. Adventure became as much of a lure as the payoff.\n\nOn the borderlands of [[Noxus]], they set two renowned houses at each other's throats as cover for the rescue of an heir apparent being held hostage. That they pocketed the reward money only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder should have come as no surprise to their employer. In [[Piltover]], they hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the two empty the vault of its treasures, but they tricked its guards into loading it onto their hijacked cargo ship. Only once the pair were over the horizon was the theft discovered, along with Fate's trademark playing card.\n\nBut eventually their luck ran out. During a heist that went wrong, Twisted Fate seemingly betrayed and abandoned his partner. Graves was taken alive and thrown in the infamous prison known as the Locker.\n\nYears of imprisonment and torture followed, during which time Graves nursed his hatred for his former partner. A lesser man would surely have broken, but Malcolm Graves endured it all and finally escaped. He clawed his way to freedom and began his pursuit of Twisted Fate, the man whose treachery consigned him to a decade of unspeakable misery.\n\nYears later, Graves finally had his showdown with Twisted Fate. Yet, after learning the truth of what had gone down between them and escaping certain death at the hands of {{ci|Gangplank}} with his old comrade, Graves put his vengeance aside. Older, if not wiser, the pair look to pick up where they left off, seeking to make themselves rich using their unique blend of trickery, heists, and focused violence.\n\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P2.png|left|150px]]\n\nHoled up in an empty bar, bleeding from a dozen wounds and surrounded by armed men who wanted him dead, Malcolm Graves had seen better days. He'd seen worse ones, too, so he wasn't worried yet. Graves leaned over the smashed bar and helped himself to a bottle, sighing as he read the label.\n\n''&quot;[[Demacia]]n wine? That all you got?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's the most expensive bottle I have... &quot;'' said the innkeeper, cowering below the bar in a glittering ocean of broken glass.\n\nGraves looked around the bar and grinned.\n\n''&quot;I reckon it's the only bottle you got left.&quot;''\n\nThe man had panic written all over him. He clearly wasn't used to being in the middle of a gunfight. This wasn't [[Bilgewater]], where fatal brawls broke out ten times a day. [[Piltover]] was regarded a more civilized city than Graves' hometown. In some ways, at least.\n\nHe yanked the cork free with his teeth and spat it to the floor before taking a swig. He swilled it around his mouth like he'd seen rich folks do before swallowing it.\n\n''&quot;Pisswater&quot;'', he said, ''&quot;but beggars can\u2019t be choosers, huh?&quot;''\n\nA voice shouted through the broken windows, buoyed with confidence it hadn't earned and the false bravado of numbers.\n\n''&quot;Give it up, Graves. There's seven of us to one of you. This ain't going to end well.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Damn straight it ain't&quot;'', hollered Graves in return. ''&quot;If you want to walk away from this, you best go fetch more men!&quot;''\n\nHe took another swig from the bottle, then put it down on the bar.\n\n''&quot;Time to get to work&quot;'', he said, lifting {{ai|New Destiny|Graves|his one-of-a-kind shotgun}} from the bar.\n\nGraves reloaded, pushing fresh shells home. The weapon snapped together with a satisfyingly lethal sound, loud enough to carry to the men outside. Anyone who knew him would know that sound and what it meant.\n\nThe outlaw slid off the barstool and made his way to the door, glass crunching beneath his boot heels. He stooped to glance through a cracked window. Four men crouched behind makeshift cover: two on the upper floor of a fancy workshop, another two in shadowed doorways to either side. All held crossbows or muskets at the ready.\n\n''&quot;We tracked you halfway across the world, you son of a bitch&quot;'', shouted the same voice. ''&quot;Bounty didn't say nothin' about you being alive or dead. Walk out now with that cannon of yours held high and there don't need to be no more bloodshed.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Oh, I'm comin' out&quot;'', shouted Graves. ''&quot;Don't you worry none about that.&quot;''\n\nHe drew a {{ai|Silver Serpent|Gangplank}} from his pocket and flipped it onto the bar, where it spun through a pool of spilled rum before landing heads up. A trembling hand reached up to take it. Graves grinned.\n\n''&quot;That's for the door&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;What about the door?&quot;'' asked the innkeeper.\n\nGraves hammered his boot into the inn's front door, smashing it from its hinges. {{ai|Quickdraw|Graves|He dived}} through the splintered frame, rolling to one knee, gun blasting from the hip.\n\n''&quot;Alright, you bastards!&quot;'' he roared.

Each track is the size of a tusklord; its claws like scimitars. It could rend a man in half. Finally, worthy prey.\n\nAs I stalk my prize through the jungle, I begin to see the damage this thing has wrought. I step into a misshapen circle of splintered trees. These giant wooden sentinels have stood over this land for countless ages, their iron-like hides untouched by the flimsy axes of anyone foolish enough to attempt to cut them down. This thing brushed them aside like they were twigs.\n\nHow can a creature with this level of strength disappear so easily?

It will make a tremendous trophy.\n\nPassing through the clearing, I follow the sound of a stream to get my bearings once more. There I see a small shock of orange fur, crouching, waiting. I spy on it from a distance. A tiny fish splashes out of the stream and the creature scrambles for it, diving gleefully into the rushing water. To my joy, I realize it's {{ci|Gnar|a yordle}}. And a hunter, at that!\n\nThis is a good omen. The beast will be found. Nothing will escape me.\n\nThe yordle's large ears perk up and face towards me.

I cannot allow him to disrupt my hunt. I face him and point into the distance. He looks at me quizzically. I need to be more insistent, good omen or no.\n\nI rear back and {{ai|Battle Roar|Rengar|let out a roar}}, the wind whipping the yordle's fur and the ground rumbling beneath us. After a few short seconds, he turns his head and, with what I think could be a smile, he holds up his small boomerang. There can be no further delay. I snatch the weapon out of his hand and expertly throw it into a tree, impaling it high amongst the branches. He turns and scrambles for it, {{ai|Hop|Gnar|jumping frantically}}.\n\nI barely get ten paces when a roar shakes me to my very spine. The deafening crack of stone and wood echoes all around.

She was hailed as a prodigy, drawing the affections of the Demacian government, military, and citizens alike.\n\nAs one of the youngest women to be tested by the College of Magic, she was discovered to possess a unique command over the powers of light. The young Lux viewed this as a great gift, something for her to embrace and use in the name of good. Realizing her unique skills, the Demacian military recruited and trained her in covert operations.\n\nShe quickly became renowned for her daring achievements; the most dangerous of which found her deep in the chambers of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] High Command. She extracted valuable inside information about the Noxus-[[Ionia]]n conflict, earning her great favor with Demacians and Ionians alike.\n\nHowever, reconnaissance and surveillance was not for her. A light of her people, Lux's true calling was [[the League of Legends]], where she could follow in {{ci|Garen|her brother}}'s footsteps and unleash her gifts as an inspiration for all of Demacia.\n\n", "id": 99}, "Shyvana": {"key": "Shyvana", "name": "Shyvana", "title": "the Half-Dragon", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shyvana\n|alias        = * The Half-Dragon\n|render       = [[File:Shyvana Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = Half Human, half Dragon\n|birthplace   = Unknown\n|residence    = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation   = * Elite Guard of [[Demacia]]\n|faction      = * [[File:Demacia_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Jarvan IV, Galio\n|rivals       =\n|related      =\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\nA half-breed born from the union between dragon and human, Shyvana searched all her life for belonging. Persecution forged her into a brutal warrior, and those who dare stand against Shyvana face the fiery beast lurking just beneath her skin.\n\nDragonkind considered Shyvana's impure blood an abomination, and she spent her youth pursued relentlessly by one cruel drake. Constantly on the run, she and her father, an outcast dragon, never knew a lasting home. A brutal reflection of countless battles, Shyvana grew hateful and savage. After years of strife, her father finally fell to the other dragon, but not before gravely wounding his foe. Furious with grief, Shyvana pursued her father\u2019s murderer as he fled north to recover. There she encountered a group of humans on the trail of the same drake. Though the men looked upon her in fear, their leader approached Shyvana peacefully. He introduced himself as {{ci|Jarvan IV}}, the Prince of [[Demacia]], and offered to aid Shyvana in her quest for vengeance. Together they hunted down and confronted the vicious dragon that had slain her father. Shyvana did not expect the men to survive, but in the clash of fire and steel, Jarvan and his men fought with strength she had never believed humans to possess. The ironclad warriors drove their foe into submission, and Shyvana struck the final blow, tearing the beast's heart from its body. Inspired by her ferocity, Jarvan offered her a place in the ranks of his elite guard. Shyvana could still see fear in the eyes of his men, but she longed for a true home.

Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n\n{{ci|Renekton}} was born to fight. From a young age he was constantly getting into vicious brawls. He had no fear, and was able to hold his own against much older children. It was often pride that led to these confrontations, as Renekton was unable to back down, or let any insult pass. Every evening, he came home with cuts and fresh bruises, and while his more scholarly older brother, {{ci|Nasus}}, disapproved of his street-fighting, Renekton relished it.\n\nNasus soon moved away, having been chosen to join the elite Collegium of the Sun, and in the years he was absent, Renekton\u2019s skirmishes became increasingly serious. On a rare visit home, Nasus was horrified to see his bloodied young brother return home from yet another street fight. Fearing Renekton\u2019s violent nature would see him imprisoned or in an early grave, Nasus helped him enlist in the Shuriman army. Officially, Renekton was too young for this duty, but his older brother\u2019s influence smoothed away this detail.\n\nThe discipline and regimentation of the army was a blessing for Renekton. Within a few years, he rose to become one of Shurima\u2019s most feared and capable war-captains, and he fought on the front line in numerous wars of conquest to expand the empire. He garnered a reputation for ferocity and toughness, but also for honor and bravery. Nasus became a decorated general, and the two of them served in a number of campaigns together, remaining very close despite their inherent differences and frequent disagreements. Nasus\u2019s skill lay in strategy, logistics and history; Renekton\u2019s lay in battle. Nasus planned the wars, and Renekton won them.\n\nRenekton earned the title Gatekeeper of Shurima after fighting a desperate battle in one of the mountain passes bordering Shurima. An invading force had landed on the south coast, striking toward the isolated city of Zuretta. If it was not halted, the city was certain to be razed, and its populace massacred. Outnumbered ten to one, Renekton and a small contingent faced these aggressors, determined to buy time for the city to be evacuated. It was a battle that none expected Renekton to survive, let alone win. He held the pass for a day and a night, long enough for a relief force led by Nasus to arrive. With barely a handful of warriors left standing, none uninjured, Renekton was hailed a hero.\n\nRenekton served on the frontlines for decades, and never lost a battle. His presence was inspiring to those fighting alongside him, and terrifying to his enemies. Victory after victory were his, and such was his reputation that some wars were won without a sword even being lifted, enemy nations surrendering as soon as they heard Renekton was marching on them.\n\nRenekton was of middling years, a grizzled and battle-scarred veteran, when word reached him that his brother was close to death. He raced back to the capital to find Nasus a pale shadow of his former self, having been struck down by a debilitating wasting malady. The sickness was incurable, similar to the rotting curse said to have cut down an entire noble line in antiquity.\n\nNevertheless, Nasus\u2019s greatness was recognized by one and all. As well as being a highly decorated general, he curated the great library of Shurima, and penned many of the finest literary works in the empire. The priesthood proclaimed it to be the sun\u2019s will that he undertake the Ascension ritual.\n\nThe whole city gathered to witness the holy rite, but the tragic illness had taken a terrible toll, and Nasus no longer had the strength to scale the stairs to the Ascension dais. In the ultimate act of self-sacrifice and love, Renekton lifted his brother in his arms, and climbed the final steps, fully expecting to be obliterated in the process by the holy energies of the sun disc. He deemed his sacrifice a small thing to ensure that his brother would live on. He was just a warrior, after all, albeit a talented one, while his brother was a peerless scholar, thinker and general. Renekton knew that Shurima would need Nasus in the years to come.\n\nRenekton was not destroyed, however. Beneath the blinding radiance of the sun disc, both brothers were raised up and remade. When the light faded, two mighty Ascended beings stood before the onlookers, Nasus in his lean, jackal-headed body, and Renekton in his immense, crocodilian form. Their forms seemed apt; the jackal was often regarded as the most clever and cunning of beasts, and the fearless aggression of the crocodile fit Renekton perfectly. Shurima gave thanks to have these new demigods as guardians of the empire.\n\nRenekton had been a mighty war hero before, but now he was an Ascended being, blessed with power beyond mortal understanding. He was stronger and faster than any regular man, and seemed virtually immune to pain. Though Ascended beings were not immortal, their lifespans were dramatically increased, so that they might serve the empire for hundreds of years.\n\nWith Renekton at the head of the Shuriman armies, the empire\u2019s military was all but unstoppable. He had always been a ruthless commander and ferocious fighter, but his new form gave him power beyond belief. He led the soldiers of Shurima to many bloody victories, neither giving nor expecting mercy. His legend spread far beyond the borders of the empire, and it was his enemies that gave him the name Butcher of the Sands, a title he embraced.\n\nThere were those, Nasus among them, who came to believe that a portion of Renekton\u2019s humanity had been lost in his transformation. As the years progressed, he seemed to become crueler, relishing the spilling of blood more than was natural, and whispers circulated of atrocities he committed in the name of war. Nevertheless, he was a staunch defender of Shurima, and he faithfully served a succession of emperors, ensuring the security and greatness of Shurima for hundreds of years.\n\nDuring the reign of the Emperor {{ci|Azir}}, word arrived that a magical {{ci|Brand|being of fire}} had escaped the {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|magical sarcophagus}} that bound it in its underground prison. It had laid waste to a Shuriman town, before fleeing across the desert to the east. Renekton and his brother Nasus set forth to recapture this legendary foe. While they were absent, the young emperor, guided by the manipulations of his magus, {{ci|Xerath}}, attempted to join their ranks and become one of the Ascended. The results were catastrophic.\n\nReneketon and Nasus were a day\u2019s ride from the capital, but even so, they felt the shockwave as the Ascension ritual went awry. Knowing that something terrible had come to pass, they raced back to find the glorious city in ruins. Azir had been killed, along with most of the city\u2019s populace, and the great sun disc was falling, drained of all its power.  At the epicenter of the ruin, they encountered Xerath, now a being of pure, malevolent power.\n\nThe brothers sought to bind Xerath in the magical sarcophagus that had held the ancient being of fire. For a day and a night they battled, but the magus was powerful, and would not be held. He shattered the sarcophagus, and assailed them with spells fueled by the power of sun disc, which crashed to the ground as they fought.\n\nKnowing that they could not destroy Xerath, Renekton finally wrestled him into the depthless Tomb of the Emperors, and bade his brother seal them inside forever. Knowing there was no other way to stop Xerath, Nasus reluctantly did as his brother ordered. As Renekton and Xerath fell into darkness, Nasus sealed the tomb for all eternity.\n\nIn the darkness, Xerath and Renekton continued their battle. For uncounted years they fought, as the once-great civilization of Shurima collapsed to dust in the world above. Xerath whispered poison in Renekton\u2019s ear, and gradually, as the centuries rolled on, his viperous words and the ever-present darkness took its toll. The magus implanted the notion in Renekton\u2019s mind that Nasus had sealed him in on purpose, jealous of his success, and unwilling to share his Ascension.\n\nPiece by piece, Renekton\u2019s sanity cracked. Xerath drove a wedge into these cracks, corrupting his mind and twisting his perception of what was real and what was imagined.\n\nThousands of years later, the Tomb of the Emperors was opened by the mercenary {{ci|Sivir}}, freeing Renekton and Xerath. Renekton roared his fury and thundered out into the Shuriman desert, sniffing the air for the scent of his brother.\n\nRenekton now roams the deserts, seeking the death of Nasus, the traitor he believes left him to die. His grip on reality is tenuous at best, and while there are moments when he resembles the proud, honorable hero of the past, much of the time he is little more than a devolved hate-maddened beast, driven on by the thirst for blood and vengeance.\n\n", "id": 58}, "Fiora": {"key": "Fiora", "name": "Fiora", "title": "the Grand Duelist", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Fiora\n|real_name = Fiora Laurent\n|alias = The Grand Duelist\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Bladework|Fiora|Laurent Bluesteel Rapier}}\n* &lt;small&gt;({{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|Zero Pulse Blade}} {{w|Alternative future|* }})&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Fiora Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n* Head of House Laurent \n* &lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiate {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n* [[File:House Laurent Crest.png|18px|link=]] [[Demacia|House Laurent]]\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Jax, Lux\n|related = \n* [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;I have come to kill you for the sake of honor.

Born to House Laurent in the Kingdom of [[Demacia]], Fiora took control of the family from her father in the wake of a scandal that nearly destroyed them. House Laurent's reputation was sundered, but Fiora bends her every effort to restore her family's honor and return them to their rightful place among the great and good of Demacia.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:House Laurent Crest.png|left|150px]]\n\nFrom an early age, Fiora defied every expectation placed upon her. Her mother had the finest craftsmen of Demacia fashion the most lifelike dolls for her. Fiora gave them to her maids and took up her brother's rapier, forcing him to give her lessons in secret. Her father obtained a host of dressmaking mannequins for her personal seamstress to craft wondrous dresses. Fiora used them to practice {{ai|Lunge|Fiora|lunges}} and {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|ripostes}}.\n\nAt every stage in her life, Fiora has embodied all that is noble in Demacia, striving for perfection in all things and brooking no insult to her honor or that of her family's ideals. As the youngest daughter of House Laurent, she was destined for a life as a political pawn, to be married off in the grand game of alliances between patrician houses. This did not sit well with Fiora, whose temperament saw only dishonor in being maneuvered by another's will, even that of her beloved father. Despite her resistance, a politically advantageous marriage was arranged with an outlying branch of {{ci|Garen|House}} {{ci|Lux|Crownguard}}, and plans were set for a summer wedding.\n\nThe ancient families of Demacia sent their invited representatives to House Laurent to attend the marriage ceremony, but instead of meekly accepting her fate, Fiora defied it. She declared before the assembled host that she would sooner die than be dishonored by allowing someone else to control her fate. Her husband-to-be was publicly shamed and his family demanded a duel to the death to wipe away Fiora's scandalous insult.\n\nFiora immediately stepped forward, but as Master of House Laurent, it was her father's duty to accept. The champion of House Crownguard was a truly deadly warrior, and defeat was almost certain. To lose would see House Laurent ruined and his daughter exiled in disgrace. Presented with so stark a choice, Fiora's father made a decision that would damn his family for years to come. That night, he attempted to drug his opponent with a draught to rob his blows of speed, but his attempt was discovered and the Master of House Laurent was arrested.\n\nDemacian law is notoriously harsh and unforgiving. Its justice allows no leeway, and Fiora's father had broken its most fundamental code of honor. He would suffer public humiliation upon the executioner's scaffold, hanged like a common criminal, and his entire family expelled from Demacia. On the eve of his death, Fiora visited her father's cell, but what passed between them is a secret known only to her.\n\nAn ancient and all but forgotten code of honor allowed for a family member to expunge the shame of one of its number in blood, and thus avoid the virtual death-sentence of exile. Knowing they had no choice, father and daughter faced each other within the Hall of Blades. Justice would not be served by a mere slaying, Fiora's father had to fight and be fought. The battle was blindingly swift, {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|a dance of blades}} so exquisite that those who witnessed it would never forget what they had seen. Fiora's father was a fine swordsman in his own right, but he was no match for his daughter. They said farewell in every clash of the blade, but in the end a tearful Fiora buried her rapier in {{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|her father's heart}} and assured her family's continued place in Demacia. With her father dead at her feet, Fiora became the head of House Laurent (much to the surprise of her older brothers... )\n\nThough the honor of House Laurent was not entirely ruined, scandals are not easily erased. In the years that followed, Fiora proved a sagacious leader of her House and swiftly learned not to make the mistakes of brash youth. She became a formidable mistress of blade and negotiation, cutting to the heart of any matter with her customary clarity and seemingly cruel directness. Some still speak of her House's disgrace or decry how standards have fallen that a woman should dare call herself ruler of a noble House, but only in private. For when such gossip reaches Fiora's ear, she is quick to call out those rumormongers and {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|demand justice}} on the edge of a sword. Yet even here, she is not without pragmatic cunning, offering each challenger a way out that will allow honor to be satisfied without death. So far, none have accepted her offers, and none have ever walked away from a duel with Fiora.\n\nWith the fortunes of House Laurent on the rise, Fiora has no shortage of suitors, but none have yet proven worthy of her hand. Many suspect Fiora herself puts every suitor through an impossible gauntlet of courtship in order to remain aloof and unmarried, for a wife would, traditionally, relinquish power to her husband.\n\nAnd Fiora has never done anything traditionally.\n\n[[File:House Laurent Crest.png|left|150px]]\n\nThe man {{ci|Fiora}} was going to kill was named Umberto. He had the look of a man very sure of himself. She watched him talking to four men, so alike they must surely be his brothers. The five of them were cocksure and preening, as though it was beneath their dignity to even present themselves in the Hall of Blades in answer to her challenge.\n\nDawn's light cast angled spars of light through the lancet windows, and the pale marble shimmered with the reflections of those who had come to see a life ended. They lined the edges of the hall by the score, members of both Houses, lackeys, gawkers and some simply with unhealthy appetites to see bloodshed.\n\n''&quot;My lady&quot;'', said Ammdar, her second older brother, handing her {{ai|Bladework|Fiora|a mid-length rapier}} with a bluesteel blade upon which light moved like oil. ''&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course&quot;'', replied Fiora. ''&quot;You heard the tales Umberto and his braggart brothers were spreading in the Commercia?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I did&quot;'', confirmed Ammdar. ''&quot;But is that worth his death?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;If I let one braggart slide, then others will think themselves free to wag their tongues&quot;'', said Fiora.\n\nAmmdar nodded, and stepped back. ''&quot;Then do what you must.&quot;''\n\nFiora stepped forward, rolling her shoulders and sweeping her blade twice through the air \u2013 a sign the duel was about to begin. Umberto turned as one his brothers nudged him in the ribs, and anger touched Fiora as she saw his frank appraisal of her physique, an appraisal that lingered far too long below her neck. He drew his own weapon, a long, beautifully curved [[Demacia]]n cavalry saber with golden quillons and a sapphire inset on the pommel. A poseur's weapon and one entirely unsuited to the requirements of a duel.\n\nUmberto stepped up to his duelists' mark and repeated the sword movements she had made. He bowed to her and winked. Fiora felt her jaw tighten, but clamped down on her dislike. Emotion had no place in a duel. It clouded swordplay and had seen many a great swordsman slain by a lesser opponent.\n\nThey circled one another, making the prescribed movements of foot and blade like dance partners at the first notes of a waltz. The movements were to ensure that both participants in the duel were aware of the significance of what they were soon to attempt.\n\nThe rituals of the duel were important. They, like The Measured Tread, were designed to allow civilized folk to maintain the illusion of nobility in killing. Fiora knew they were good laws, just laws, but that didn't take away from the fact that she was about to kill the man before her. And because Fiora believed in these laws, she had to make her offer.\n\n''&quot;Good sir, I am Fiora of House Laurent&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Save it for your grave-marker&quot;'', snapped Umberto.\n\nShe ignored his puerile attempt to rile her and said, ''&quot;It has come to my attention that you did injure the good name of House Laurent in an unjust and dishonorable manner by the indulgence and spreading of malicious falsehoods in regards to the legitimacy of my lineage. Therefore it is my right to {{ai|Grand Challenge|Fiora|challenge you to a duel}} and restore the honor of my House in your blood.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I already know this&quot;'' said Umberto, playing to the crowd. ''&quot;I'm here aren't I?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You have come to your death&quot;'', promised Fiora. ''&quot;Unless you choose not to fight by giving me satisfaction for your offense.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;How might I give milady satisfaction?&quot;'' asked Umberto.\n\n''&quot;Given the nature of your offense, submit to having your right ear severed from your head.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;What? Are you mad, woman?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It's that or I kill you&quot;'', said Fiora, as though they were discussing the weather. ''&quot;You know how this duel will end. There is no loss of face in yielding.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Of course there is&quot;'' said Umberto, and Fiora saw he still thought he could win. Like everyone else, he underestimated her.\n\n''&quot;All here know my skill with a blade, so choose to live and wear your wound as a badge of honor. Or choose death, and be food for crows by midmorning.&quot;''\n\nFiora raised her blade. ''&quot;But choose now.&quot;''\n\nHis anger at what he assumed was her arrogance overcame his fear and he stamped forward, the tip of his sword thrusting for her heart. Fiora had read the attack before it was launched and made a quarter turn to the left, letting the curved blade cut only air. Her own blade swept up, then down {{ai|Duelist's Dance|Fiora|in a precise, diagonal arc}}. The crowd gasped at the wet spatter of blood on stone and the shocking suddenness of the duel's ending.\n\nFiora turned as Umberto's sword clattered to the granite flagstones. He fell to his knees, then slumped back onto his haunches, hands clutched to his opened throat from which blood pumped enthusiastically.\n\nShe bowed to Umberto, but his eyes were already glassy and unseeing with impending death. Fiora took no pleasure in such a slaying, but the fool had left her little choice. Umberto's brothers came forward to collect the corpse, and she felt their shock at their brother's defeat.\n\n''&quot;How many is that?&quot;'' asked Ammdar, coming forward to collect her sword. ''&quot;Fifteen? Twenty?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Thirty&quot;'', said Fiora. ''&quot;Or maybe more. They all look the same to me now.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There will be more&quot;'', promised her brother.\n\n''&quot;So be it&quot;'', answered Fiora. ''&quot;But every death restores our family honor. Every death brings redemption closer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Redemption for whom?&quot;'' asked Ammdar.\n\nBut Fiora did not answer.\n\n", "id": 114}, "Jinx": {"key": "Jinx", "name": "Jinx", "title": "the Loose Cannon", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jinx\n|alias = The Loose Cannon\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Pow-Pow|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt;([[File:ProfileIcon1387.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Jinx#Pow=Pow|Shiro]], {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Fishbones|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt;([[File:ProfileIcon1388.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Jinx#Fishbones|Kuro]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Zap!|Jinx}}\n* &lt;small&gt; ([[File:ProfileIcon1382.jpg|20px|link=]] [[Star Guardian|First Star's Light]] {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}})\n* {{ai|Flame Chompers!|Jinx}}\n* {{ai|Super Mega Death Rocket!|Jinx}}\n|render = Jinx Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = The Slums, [[Zaun]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Criminal\n* Psychopath\n* &lt;s&gt;[[Zaun]] Gang Member&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardian {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[Zaun]] &lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(Star Guardians {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Ekko\n|friends = \n|rivals = Caitlyn, Vi, Jayce\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/star-guardian-2016 Star Guardian]\n}}\n", "background": "\n[[File:Jinx quote.png|center|550px]]\n\n[[File:Jinx's Weapons.png|left]]\n\nJinx lives to wreak havoc without a thought for consequence, leaving a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake.

With a caricature of Vi's face splashed across the treasury's facade, and with a time and date of her supposed raid, Jinx was openly daring the enforcer to stop her from robbing it.\n\nDetermined to put the troublemaker behind bars, Vi watched and waited outside the treasury until Jinx's time had finally come. True to her scrawled promise, the smiling menace showed her face. Knowing this was her chance to capture the outlaw, Vi gave chase into the building's interior. She smashed through wall after wall to chase down Jinx, who giggled as she lit up the evacuated treasury with fiery explosions. Vi finally cornered the criminal inside the vault, but Jinx wasn't done just yet. With a maniacal laugh, she fired a barrage of rockets, bringing the entire building down upon them both.\n\nWhen Vi finally crawled out of the ruins, the battered enforcer found no trace of Jinx. Adding insult to injury, not a single ounce of gold had been taken from the ruined vault. Instead, the criminal left a parting message to her favorite officer of the law - a challenge only now visible through the gaping opening in Piltover's skyline. The lights of the city spelled out a simple taunt: you'll never catch me. As Vi read the message, she heard the distant laughter of her new nemesis, and the city plunged into utter darkness for the very first time.\n\n", "id": 222}, "Kalista": {"key": "Kalista", "name": "Kalista", "title": "the Spear of Vengeance", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kalista\n|alias = \n* The Spear of Vengeance\n* The Lady of Vengeance\n* &lt;s&gt;General Kalista&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Pierce|Kalista|Soul Spears}}\n* {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|Soul Sentinels}}\n* {{ii|The Black Spear}}\n|render = Kalista Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Female\n|race = Specter &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = Spirit of Vengeance\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|enemies = Cassiopeia, LeBlanc, Lissandra, Hecarim, Zed\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/kalista?_k=cw2on3 Spear of Vengeance]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;When wronged, we seek justice. When hurt, we strike back. When betrayed, the Spear of Vengeance strikes!&quot;'' - {{ci|Kalista}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nA specter of wrath and retribution, Kalista is the undying spirit of vengeance, an armored nightmare summoned from the [[Shadow Isles]] to hunt deceivers and traitors. The betrayed may cry out in blood to be avenged, but Kalista only answers those whose cause she deems worthy of her skills. Woe betide those who become the focus of Kalista's wrath, for {{ii|The Black Spear|any pact}} sealed with this grim hunter can only end on the cold fire of {{ai|Pierce|Kalista|her soul-spears}}.\n\n==Lore==\nIn life, Kalista was a proud general, niece to the powerful {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|king}} of an empire none now recall. She lived by a strict code of honor and expected others to do the same, serving her king and queen with utmost loyalty. Her king had many enemies, and when the rulers of a conquered land sent an assassin to slay him, only the speed of Kalista's sword arm averted disaster. But in saving the king, she damned the queen. The assassin's deflected blade was envenomed and sliced the arm of the king's wife. The greatest priests, surgeons and sorcerers were summoned, but none could draw the poison from the queen's body. Even the king's magic could only slow its progress. Wracked with grief, the king dispatched Kalista to quest for a cure. Before departing, she tasked {{ci|Hecarim}} of the Iron Order to stand at the king's side in her stead. He reluctantly accepted this task, bitter at being denied the chance to join Kalista.\n\nKalista traveled the world, seeking a cure from learned scholars, hermits and mystics, but always without success. Finally, she learned of a legendary island beyond the ken of mortal eyes, a place said to hold the key to eternal life - the Blessed Isles - and set sail on a last voyage of hope. The island's inhabitants knew of her quest and, seeing the purity of her intent, drew her boat to the shores of their island. Kalista begged them to heal the queen, and the master of the order instructed Kalista to bring her to the island, where they would cleanse her body. As Kalista boarded her ship, she was given arcane words to pierce the glamours protecting the island, but was warned against sharing that knowledge. Kalista sailed for her homeland, but arrived too late; the queen was already dead.\n\nThe king had descended into grief-stricken madness, locking himself in his tower with the queen's festering corpse. Her uncle learned of Kalista's return and demanded she tell him what she had found. With heavy heart, for she had never before broken her oath to the king, Kalista refused, remembering the warning given to her and knowing there was no purpose in bringing a corpse to the island. The king named her a traitor and imprisoned her until such time she relented. There Kalista remained until Hecarim convinced her to tell the king what she knew. He urged her to let the king find peace, either in his wife returning to him or in finally accepting she was gone and allowing her to be buried on the Blessed Isles. Between them they could assuage the king's madness and bring him back with no harm being done. Hesitantly, for she sensed something amiss in Hecarim, Kalista agreed.\n\nAnd so the king sailed for the Blessed Isles with a flotilla of his fastest ships. Kalista spoke the mystic words to undo the veil shrouding their destination and the king cried out as its glittering coast was revealed. The king marched towards a distant white city at the centre of the island where he was met by the master of the island's guardians. The king ordered the man to bring his wife back from the dead, but was told that trying to cheat death went against the natural order of the world. The king flew into a fevered rage and commanded Kalista to kill the guardian.\n\nKalista refused and spoke of the great man he had once been, but her appeals fell on deaf ears and he again ordered the guardian's death. Kalista called on Hecarim to stand with her, but Hecarim now saw a chance to realize his long-simmering ambition of replacing Kalista as the king's favorite. He stepped towards Kalista as if to stand at her side, but instead drove {{ii|The Black Spear|his spear}} through her back in a monstrous act of betrayal. The Iron Order joined him in treachery, their own spears plunging into Kalista's body as she fell. A brutal melee erupted, with those devoted to Kalista fighting desperately against Hecarim and his knights. Despite their courage and skill, their numbers were too few and Hecarim's men slew them to a man. As Kalista's life faded and she watched her warriors die, she swore vengeance with her dying breath upon those who had betrayed her.\n\nWhen next Kalista opened {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|her eyes}}, they were filled with the dark power of unnatural magic. The Blessed Isles had been transformed into [[Shadow Isles|a twisted mockery]] of life and beauty, a place of darkness filled with howling spirits condemned for all eternity to the nightmare of undeath. She knew nothing of how this had happened, and even as she clung to her last memories of betrayal, they slowly faded until all that remained was a thirst for vengeance burning in her ruined chest.\n\nA thirst that can only be slaked in the blood of traitors.\n\n;Invocation\nThe sword-wife stood amid the burnt out ruin of her home. Everything and everyone that mattered to her was gone, and she was filled with fathomless grief... and hate. Hate was now all that compelled her.\n\nShe saw again the smile on his face as he gave the order. He was meant to be their protector, but he'd spat upon his vows. Hers was not the only family shattered by the oath-breaker.\n\nThe desire to go after him was strong. She wanted nothing more than to plant her sword in his chest and watch the life drain from his eyes... but she knew she would never be able to get close enough to him. He was guarded day and night, and she was but one warrior. She would never be able to fight her way through his battalion alone. Such a death would serve no purpose.\n\nShe took a shuddering breath, knowing there was no coming back.\n\nA crude effigy of a man, formed of sticks and twine, lay upon a fire-blackened dresser. Its body was wrapped in a scrap of cloth torn from the cloak of the betrayer. She'd pried it from her husband's dead grasp. Alongside it was a hammer and three rusted nails.\n\nShe gathered everything up and moved to the threshold. The door itself was gone, smashed to splinters in the attack. Beyond, lit by moonlight, lay the empty, darkened fields.\n\nReaching up, the sword-wife pressed the stick-effigy to the hardwood lintel.\n\n''&quot;I invoke thee, Lady of Vengeance&quot;'', she said, her voice low, trembling with the depth of her fury. ''&quot;From beyond the veil, hear my plea. Come forth. Let justice be done.&quot;''\n\nShe readied her hammer and the first of the nails.\n\n''&quot;I name my betrayer once&quot;'', she said, and spoke his name aloud. As she did so, she placed the tip of the first nail to the chest of the stick-figure. With a single strike, she hammered it in deep, pinning it to the hardwood door frame.\n\nThe sword-wife shivered. The room had become markedly colder. Or had she imagined it?\n\n''&quot;I name him twice&quot;'', she said, and she did so, hammering the second nail alongside the first.\n\nHer gaze dropped, and she jolted in shock. A dark figure stood out in the moonlit field, a hundred yards in the distance. It was utterly motionless. Breathing quicker, the sword-wife returned her attention to the unfinished task.\n\n''&quot;I name him thrice&quot;'', she said, speaking again the name of the murderer of her husband and children, before hammering home the final nail.\n\nAn ancient spirit of vengeance stood before her, filling the doorway, and the sword-wife staggered back, gasping involuntarily.\n\nThe otherworldly being was clad in archaic armor, her flesh translucent and glowing with spectral un-light. Black Mist coiled around her like a living shroud.\n\nWith a squeal of tortured metal, the spectral figure drew forth {{ii|The Black Spear|the blackened spear}} protruding from her breastplate - the ancient weapon that had ended her life.\n\nShe threw it to the ground before the sword-wife. No words were spoken; there was no need. The sword-wife knew what was being offered to her - vengeance - and knew its terrible cost: her soul.\n\nThe spirit watched on, her face impassive and {{ai|Sentinel|Kalista|her eyes burning}} with an unrelenting cold fury, as the sword-wife picked up the treacherous weapon.\n\n''&quot;I pledge myself to vengeance&quot;'', said the sword-wife, her voice quivering. She reversed the spear, aiming the tip inward, towards her heart. ''&quot;I pledge it with my blood. I pledge it with my soul.&quot;''\n\nShe paused. Her husband would have pleaded for her to turn away from this path. He would have begged her not to condemn her soul with this course of action. A moment of doubt gnawed at her. The undying specter watched on.\n\nThe sword-wife's eyes narrowed as she thought of her husband lying dead, cut down by swords and axes. She thought again of her children, sprawled upon the ground, and her resolve hardened like a cold stone in her heart. Her grip tightened upon the spear.\n\n''&quot;Help me&quot;'', she implored, her decision made. ''&quot;Please, help me kill him.&quot;''\n\nShe rammed the spear into her chest, driving it in deep.\n\nThe sword-wife's eyes widened and she dropped to her knees. She tried to speak, but only blood bubbled from her lips.\n\nThe ghostly apparition watched her die, her expression impassive.\n\nAs the last of the lifeblood ran from her body, the shade of the sword-wife climbed to her feet. She looked down at her insubstantial hands in wonder, then at her own corpse lying dead-eyed in a growing pool of blood upon the floor. The shade's expression hardened, and a ghostly sword appeared in her hand.\n\nAn ethereal tether, little more than a wisp of light, linked the newly formed shade to the avenging spirit she had summoned. Through their bond, the sword-wife saw her differently, glimpsing the noble warrior she had been in life: tall and proud, her armor gleaming. Her posture was confident, yet without arrogance; a born leader, a born soldier. This was a commander that the sword-wife would have willingly bled for.\n\nBehind the spirit's anger, she sensed her empathy - recognition of their shared pain of betrayal.\n\n''&quot;Your cause is our cause&quot;'', said {{ci|Kalista}}, the Spear of Vengeance. Her voice was grave cold. ''&quot;We walk the path of vengeance as one, now.&quot;''\n\nThe sword-wife nodded.\n\nWith that, the avenging spirit and the shade of the sword-wife stepped into the darkness and were gone.\n\n", "id": 429}, "Fizz": {"key": "Fizz", "name": "Fizz", "title": "the Tidal Trickster", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Fizz\n|alias = The Tidal Trickster\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Seastone Trident|Fizz}}\n* {{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|Chomper}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=18667799#18667799 IronStylus on Fizz's shark's name]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ci|Urf|(Urf}} {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Fizz Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Ocean Dweller)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Guardian's Sea]]\n|residence = [[Bilgewater]]\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Void Bringer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Bilgewater Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Bilgewater]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Nami\n|rivals = Nautilus, Tahm Kench\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''{{ci|Fizz}} makes even the saltiest sailors of [[Bilgewater]] look like drunken landlubbers in a fight.

Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble.

With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted {{ai|Seastone Trident|Fizz}} from the ruins and set out alone. Fizz wandered the ocean in search of his people for years, using the skills he'd learned during his adventures as a young boy to survive.\n\nFinally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater.

As he stood at the docks, {{ai|Chum the Waters|Fizz|a massive dragon-shark}} attacked the port. Fizz defeated the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of the creature's weaknesses to his advantage.\n\nHaving earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz decided to stay in Bilgewater.

Though interpretations of Kindred's nature vary across [[Runeterra]], every mortal must choose the true face of their death.\n\n==Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\nMain=\n[[File:They Are Coming promo.png|150px|left]]\n\nKindred is the white embrace of nothingness and the gnashing of teeth in the dark. Shepherd and the butcher, poet and the primitive, they are one and both. When caught on the edge of life, louder than any trumpeting horn, it is the hammering pulse at one's throat that calls Kindred to their {{ai|Mark of the Kindred|Kindred|hunt}}. Stand and greet Lamb's silvered bow and {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|her arrows}} will lay you down swiftly. If you refuse her, Wolf will join you for his merry hunt, where every {{ai|Mounting Dread|Kindred|chase}} runs to its brutal end.\n\nFor as long as its people have known death, Kindred has stalked [[Valoran]]. When the final moment comes, it is said a true [[Demacia]]n will turn to Lamb, taking the arrow, while through the shadowed streets of [[Noxus]], Wolf leads the hunt. In the snows of the [[Freljord]], before going off to fight, some warbands 'kiss the Wolf', vowing to honor his chase with the blood of their enemies. After each [[Harrowing]], the town of [[Bilgewater]] gathers to celebrate its survivors and honor those granted a true death by Lamb and Wolf.\n\nDenying Kindred is to deny the natural order of things. There are but a wretched few who have eluded these hunters. This perverse escape is no sanctuary, for it only holds a waking nightmare. Kindred waits for those locked in the undeath of the [[Shadow Isles]], for they know all will eventually fall to Lamb's bow or Wolf's teeth.\n\nThe earliest dated appearance of the eternal hunters is from a pair of ancient masks, carved by unknown hands into the gravesites of people long-forgotten. But to this day, Lamb and Wolf remain together, and they are always Kindred.\n\n;Forest for the Trees\nThe battle spilled over like a feast before them. Such delicious life - so many to end, so many to hunt! {{ci|Wolf}} paced in the snow while {{ci|Lamb}} danced lithely from sword edge to spear tip, the red-blooded butchery never staining her pale coat.\n\n''&quot;There is courage and pain here, Wolf. Many will gladly meet their end.&quot;'' She drew up her bow and let loose an arc of swift finality.\n\nThe last breath of a soldier came with a ragged consent as his shield gave way to a heavy axe. Stuck in his heart was {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|a single white arrow}}, shimmering with ethereal brilliance.\n\n''&quot;Courage bores me&quot;'', the great black wolf grumbled as he tracked through the snow. ''&quot;I am hungry and eager to chase.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Patience&quot;'', she murmured in his shaggy ear. As soon as the words left her, Wolf's shoulders tensed and his body dropped low to the ground.\n\n''&quot;I smell fear&quot;'', he said, trembling with excitement.\n\nAcross the muddied field of snow, a squire - too young for battle, but with blade in hand, nonetheless - saw that Kindred had {{ai|Mark of the Kindred|Kindred|marked}} all in the valley.\n\n''&quot;I want the tender-thing. Does it see us, Lamb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Yes, but it must choose. Feed the Wolf, or embrace me.&quot;''\n\nThe battle turned its steel toward the squire. He now stared at the roiling tide of bravery and desperation coming for him. This would be his last dawn. In that instant, the boy made his choice. He would not go willingly. Until his last breath, he would run.\n\nWolf snapped in the air and rolled his face in the snow like a new pup.\n\n''&quot;Yes, dear Wolf.&quot;'' Lamb's voice echoed like a string of pearly bells. ''{{ai|Mounting Dread|Kindred|&quot;Begin your hunt.&quot;}}''\n\nWith that, Wolf bounded across the field after the youth, a howl thundering through the valley. His shadowed body swept over the remains of the newly dead and their useless, shattered weapons.\n\nThe squire turned and ran for the woods until thick black trunks passed in a blur. He pressed on, the frozen air burning his lungs. He looked once more for his hunter, but could see nothing but the darkening trees. The shadows closed tightly around him and he suddenly realized there was no escape. It was the black body of Wolf that was everywhere at once. The chase was at its end. Wolf buried {{ai|Wolf's Frenzy|Kindred|his sharp teeth}} in the squire's neck, tearing out ribbons of vibrant life.\n\nWolf reveled in the boy's scream and crunching bones. Lamb, who had trailed behind, laughed to see such sport. Wolf turned and asked, in a voice more growl than speech, ''&quot;Is this music, Lamb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is to you&quot;'', she answered.\n\n''&quot;Again&quot;'', Wolf licked the last drop of the youth's life from his canine jaws. ''&quot;I want to chase again, little Lamb.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There are always more&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Until the day there is only {{ci|Kindred}}.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And then will you run from me?&quot;''\n\nLamb turned back to the battle. ''&quot;I would never run from you, dear Wolf.&quot;''\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|Expanded=\n;A Good Death\nMagga was about to die for the fourteenth time. She had bitten into a rotten apple - yet again. Its putrid flesh had, as always, infected her with carrionshade. The actress went through the motions of stumbling to her death while shouting her final words for all to hear.\n\n''&quot;Oh, but how wondrous a dream is life? Only now - too late! - do I wake to see its myriad of splendors&quot;'', she bemoaned.\n\nWith a puff of smoke and glittering powder, {{ci|Kindred}} made a grand entrance upon the stage. As per tradition, they were played by one actor, his head covered by two opposing masks. He approached Magga, the white mask of the {{ci|Wolf|Lamb}} facing her.\n\n''&quot;Hark! Do I hear a plea for my keenest arrow? Come, child, let the warmth of your heart fade into the cold embrace of oblivion.&quot;''\n\nMagga refused, as she had thirteen times before. Any nuance in her performance was buried beneath the ear-splitting delivery of her scream. On cue, Lamb spun around, revealing the second mask - that of the {{ci|Lamb|Wolf}}.\n\n''&quot;There is naught ye can do to stave off thine end&quot;'', growled Wolf. \n\n''&quot;I am but a poor young maiden! Please, let my piteous cry fall on all four of thine ears.&quot;''\n\nThe audience seemed enraptured by the unfolding dramatics of the ''Orphellum Mechanicals''. With the twin threats of plague and war on the tongues of those in neighboring protectorates, death dramas were all the rage.\n\nDenji, the actor portraying both Lamb and Wolf, descended upon the young actress, awkwardly baring wooden fangs. Magga offered her neck. At the threat of Wolf's bite, she triggered the device sewn into her blouse's collar. Ribbons of red fabric unspooled to the delighted pips and yelps of the audience. They'd gotten what they paid for.\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 1.png|center|800px]]\n\nBy the time the Mechanicals had staggered back to their wagon and set off in the direction of Needlebrook, there were no stars to be seen. Instead, a veil of clouds stretched across the night sky.\n\nNeedlebrook always delivered a good audience, Illusian, the company's owner and sole dramaturg, explained once more. He staggered around, drunk on his own accolades - as well as the wine Parr had grifted from the locals.\n\nThe night wore on, and the troupe had descended into bickering. Tria and Denji lambasted their playwright over the quality of his plots, which fell into a predictable structure: tragedy strikes maiden, death finds maiden, death takes maiden. Illusian argued that complicated plots detracted from a good death scene.\n\nMagga, the youngest of the bunch, agreed with Tria and Denji's diagnosis, but kept her mouth shut. Had she not stowed away in the wandering troupe's wagon, she would certainly be somewhere far more miserable. Luckily for her, the Mechanicals had recently lost several actors due to Illusian's insistence on complete artistic control. Because of his attitude - and obvious mediocrity - they were facing a drought of fresh faces. And so, the ''Orphellum Mechanicals'' agreed to contract Magga to die in all their dramatics for the foreseeable future. For which she had been grateful.\n\nIllusian was still smarting from Denji and Tria's words when he motioned to Parr, their wagoner, to stop and make camp. The inebriated auteur set out his bedroll in pride of place next to the wagon. He then threw the rest of the bedding into the long grass nearby.\n\n''&quot;Ungrateful players can sleep in the wilds&quot;'', Illusian spat, ''&quot;where they shall hopefully find their manners.&quot;''\n\nThe rest of the troupe built a fire and swapped stories. Denji and Tria had fallen asleep in each other's arms while whispering potential names for their unborn child into each other's ears. They had nattered on about the day the traveling company would stop in Jandelle, a town so perfect and peaceful they would set aside their vagabond ways to raise their child.\n\nMagga moved closer to the crackling fire so its pops and whistles would drown out the irksome affections of her traveling companions.\n\nBut sleep never came. Instead, Magga tossed and turned, thinking about the looks on the audience's faces as the coiled spurts of blood unfurled from her neckline. A pretty maiden struck dead by her own na\u00efvet\u00e9 was all the theatrical pomp Illusian could muster, but the crowd lusted after the gruesome fa\u00e7ade.\n\nEventually, she left her bedroll and set out into the woods to soothe her unsettled mind.\n\n[[File:Kindred The Wolf 1.png|center]]\n\nIn the dead of night, Magga came upon a low grassy mound with slabs of standing stone at its base. Although she could not read the inscriptions, her fingers traced the familiar etching of {{ci|Kindred}}'s twin masks. This was a place of the dead, a burial site built long ago.\n\nShe felt a chill on the back of her neck that compelled her to look up. She was not alone. Magga immediately understood what she saw, for she'd encountered a crude impersonation of them night after night. But poor Denji couldn't begin to instill the dread washing over Magga. Before her, perched on a weathered barrow-archway, was {{ci|Lamb}} herself, flanked by her ever-faithful counterpart, {{ci|Wolf}}.\n\n''&quot;I hear a beating heart!&quot;'' said Wolf, his black eyes twinkling with delight. ''&quot;May I have it?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Perhaps&quot;'', replied Lamb. ''&quot;I sense she is afraid. Speak, beautiful one. Tell us your name.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I-I would have yours first&quot;'', stammered Magga, stepping backward. Her slow escape was halted by the speedy Wolf, who materialized unsettlingly close behind her.\n\nHe spoke directly in her ear. ''&quot;We have many names.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;In the West, I am Ina to his Ani&quot;'', said Lamb. ''&quot;In the East, Farya to his Wolyo. But we are Kindred everywhere. I am always Lamb to Wolf, and he is always Wolf to Lamb.&quot;''\n\nWolf reared up and sniffed at the air.\n\n''&quot;She is playing a boring game&quot;'' said Wolf. ''&quot;Let us play a new game, one of chasing and running and biting.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;She is not playing, dear Wolf&quot;'', said the Lamb. ''&quot;She is frightened and has lost her own name. It hides behind her lips, afraid to come out. Worry not, dear child, I have found your name. We know it as you know us, Magga.&quot;''\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 2.png|center|800px]]\n\n''&quot;P-please&quot;'', Magga stammered. ''&quot;Tonight is not a very good night for---&quot;''\n\nWolf's great pink tongue lolled out of the side of his mouth, and he proceeded to cackle.\n\n''&quot;All nights are good nights for pouncing&quot;'', said Wolf, laughing.\n\n''&quot;All days are, too&quot;'', Lamb said. ''&quot;With light comes a clear shot.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There is no moon tonight!&quot;'' cried Magga. She used what Illusian had taught her - to gesture grand, so those in the back could see her movements. ''&quot;It is hidden by a blanket of clouds, tucked away from my eyes and yours. Without the moon, what would be the last thing I would see?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We see the moon&quot;'', replied Lamb, as she caressed her fabled bow. ''&quot;It is always there.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;There are no stars!&quot;'' said Magga, trying again, this time gesturing smaller and speaking quieter. ''&quot;No menagerie of twinkling diamonds, glittering in the midnight hue. What more beautiful view could one hope for whence one meets Lamb and Wolf?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This Magga-thing is playing a new game&quot;'', growled Wolf. ''&quot;It is called 'stalling'.&quot;''\n\nWolf stopped moving and cocked his head to the side. He turned his sideways snout toward Magga before speaking. ''&quot;Can we play 'Chasing the Magga-Thing and Bite Her to Bits?'?&quot;'' Wolf clacked his fangs together loudly for effect.\n\n''&quot;Let us ask her&quot;'', said Lamb. ''&quot;Magga! Do you prefer Wolf's {{ai|Wolf's Frenzy|Kindred|chase}}, or my {{ai|Dance of Arrows|Kindred|arrow}}?&quot;''\n\nMagga was trembling now. Her eyes raced to take in every last detail of the world around her. It wasn't such a bad place to depart. There was grass. There were trees. There was the ancient archway. There was stillness to the air.\n\n''&quot;I would prefer Lamb's arrow&quot;'', she said, looking at the rough crusts of bark on the trees. ''&quot;I'll imagine myself climbing to the highest boughs, like when I was a child. Only this time, I will never stop climbing. Is that what it is like to go with you?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Lamb, ''&quot;though it is a nice thought. Fear not, little maiden, we are just having our fun. You have come to us tonight; we have not come for you.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I cannot chase Magga-thing&quot;'', said Wolf, with a hint of disappointment in his voice. ''&quot;But there are other things nearby. Other things ripe for the chasing and the biting. Hurry, Lamb. I am hungry.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;For now, know that your theatrics have pleased us, and we will watch them until the day we meet again.&quot;''\n\nWolf passed over Magga and disappeared into the woods. The shadowy beast snaked away through fields of tall grass. Magga looked back toward the weathered barrow. Lamb was gone.\n\nThe actress fled.\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 3.png|center|800px]]\n\nWhen Magga returned to the encampment, she found it in utter ruin. The wagon she had only just begun to call home had been ransacked and reduced to a smoldering husk. Bits of clothing and ruined props lay strewn across the campsite.\n\nShe found Denji's body near where he'd slept. He had died protecting Tria, whose corpse lay behind him. Judging from the trails of blood, their deaths had not been slow. They had dragged themselves toward each other, their fingers entwined in one last caress before death.\n\nMagga noticed that Illusian had managed to kill two of the bandits before being burnt to a crisp along with Parr in the wagon.\n\nThe only thing that remained untouched were Denji's Lamb and Wolf masks. Magga picked them up and held them in her hands. She placed the Lamb mask over her own eyes and heard the voice of Wolf.\n\n''&quot;Chase the Magga-thing.&quot;''\n\nThe maiden ran the distance to Needlebrook, never once looking back.\n\n[[File:Kindred The Lamb 1.png|center]]\n\nThe Golden Round was filled to the brim with a sea of twinkling eyes, all glittering in excitement at the velvet curtain. The king sat in the theater with the queen and their advisers, all eagerly awaiting the onset of the dramatics. Everyone hushed as the black curtain lifted to reveal the actors.\n\nMagga sat in a quiet dressing room under the stage. She heard the crowd fall silent as she studied herself in the mirror. The luster of youth had faded from her eyes years ago, and left her with a long shock of silver running through her hair.\n\n''&quot;Madame!&quot;'' said the stagehand. ''&quot;You're not in costume yet.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No, child&quot;'', Magga said, ''&quot;I only dress at the last moment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;It is the last moment&quot;'', said the young stagehand, holding the two final pieces of Magga's costume: the same Lamb and Wolf masks from her days with the ''Orphellum Mechanicals''.\n\n''&quot;May your performance be blessed tonight&quot;'', the stagehand said.\n\nMagga prepared to leave for the stage. She slipped the masks over her head. The old chill from the dark barrow crept down her spine. She welcomed it - as always.\n\nShe enthralled the audience as she glided onto the stage, embodying Lamb's graceful movements. She thrilled the crowd with her rendition of Wolf's playful savagery. She, as the twin deaths personified, eased the suffering of her fellow actors, or ripped it from their throats, until the crowd stood on its feet and erupted in thunderous applause.\n\nIt was true. All audiences loved a good death, and they loved Magga's more than any other.\n\nEven the king and queen were on their feet in praise of her work.\n\nBut Magga heard no applause and saw no ovations. She didn't feel the stage beneath her feet, nor the hands of her fellow mummers in hers as they bowed low. All she felt was a sharp pain in her chest.\n\nWhen Magga looked out over the audience, every single face was either a lamb or a wolf.\n\n[[File:Kindred lore 4.png|center|800px]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n[[File:Kindred banner.png|center]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 203}, "Cassiopeia": {"key": "Cassiopeia", "name": "Cassiopeia", "title": "the Serpent's Embrace", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Cassiopeia\n|real_name = Cassiopeia Du Couteau\n|alias = \n* The Serpent's Embrace\n* Snake\n|weapon_pet = \n*Toxins\n*Petrifying Gaze\n|render = Cassiopeia Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Cursed by [[Shurima]]n Magic)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Shurima]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = [[Noxus|Noxian]] Noblewoman\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|friends = Katarina, Renekton, Xerath\n|enemies = Nasus, Sivir\n|related = \n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKnM6Hh5gOg/ Descent into the Tomb]\n}}\n", "background": "\n{{ci|Cassiopeia}} is a terrifying creature - half woman, half snake - whose slightest glance brings death.

He was twisted into a force of vengeance after {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|a magical cataclysm}} destroyed his home, surviving undeath only through the waters of life infused within his heartwood. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai now furiously battles to banish the scourge of unlife from the Shadow Isles and restore his home to its former beauty.\n\n==Lore==\nLong before living memory, a chain of islands erupted from deep beneath the ocean tides as blank slates of rock and clay. With its creation, the nature spirit Maokai was born. He took the form of a treant, with his tall body covered in bark and long limbs resembling branches. Maokai felt the profound loneliness of the land and its potential for teeming growth. He wandered from island to island in search of signs of life, growing ever more forlorn in his solitude.\n\nOn a hilly isle covered in soft, rich soil, Maokai sensed a boundless energy radiating from deep beneath the ground. He plunged his great roots downward until they reached a spring of magical, life-giving water and drank deeply. From this potent liquid, he grew hundreds of {{ai|Sapling Toss|Maokai|saplings}} and planted them across the islands.\n\nSoon the land was shawled with verdant forests, groves of towering virenpine, and tangled woods, all steeped in wondrous magic. Magnificent skytrees with expansive canopies and thickly winding roots covered the isles with lush green foliage. Nature spirits were drawn to the lavish vegetation, and animals reveled in the fertile greenery.\n\nWhen humans eventually came to the islands, they too thrived in the land's abundance and formed an enlightened society of scholars devoted to studying the world's mysteries. Though Maokai was wary of their presence, he saw how they respected the sanctity of the land. Sensing the deep magic within the woods, the humans built their homes in areas not heavily forested, to avoid disturbing any nature spirits. Maokai occasionally revealed himself directly to those he trusted and blessed them with knowledge of the verdant isles, even its greatest gift - the underground spring that could heal mortal wounds.\n\nCenturies passed, and Maokai lived in idyllic contentment until a fleet of soldiers from across the sea beached upon the shores of the isles. Maokai sensed something was terribly wrong. Their {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|grief-maddened king}} bore the corpse of his queen and in hopes of reviving her, bathed her decayed flesh in the healing waters. Reanimated as a rotting corpse, the queen begged to return to death. The king sought to reverse what he had done, unwittingly casting a terrible curse upon the land.\n\nFrom leagues away, Maokai felt the first ripples of the disaster that would soon devastate the isles. He sensed a horrific force gathering beneath the soil, and a bitter chill washed over him.\n\nAs the ruination spread, Maokai desperately plunged his roots deep into the ground and drank of the healing waters, saturating every fiber of his being with their magic. Before the cursed water reached him, Maokai withdrew his roots, severing all connection to the pool. He howled in rage as the sacred reservoir he had entrusted to men was fully corrupted - the spiraling coils churning underwater until nothing pure remained.\n\nMoments later, the mists surrounding the islands blackened and spread over the land, trapping all living things in an unnatural state between life and death. Maokai watched in helpless agony as all he knew - plants, nature spirits, animals, and humans alike - twisted into wretched shades. His fury grew; the great beauty he had cultivated from tiny saplings fell to ruin in an instant at the careless hand of man.\n\nThe enervating mist coiled around Maokai, and he wept as the bright flowers adorning his shoulders crumbled and fell to dust. His body shuddered and contorted into a mass of gnarled roots and tangled branches as the mist leached life from him. But Maokai's heartwood was saturated with the precious waters of life, saving him from the terrible fate of undeath.\n\nAs grotesque wraiths and horrific abominations flooded the land, Maokai was overcome by a host of lifeless men. He struck the spirits with {{ai|Sap Magic|Maokai|his branchlike limbs}} in manic violence, realizing the force of his blows could shatter them to dust. Maokai shuddered with revulsion: he had never killed before. He flew at the breathless shapes in a frenzy, but hundreds more overwhelmed him, and eventually he was forced to retreat.\n\nWith his home all but decimated and his companions turned to deathless horrors, Maokai was tempted to try and escape the nightmare of the isles. But from deep within his twisted form, he felt the sacred waters giving him life. He had survived the Ruination by carrying the very heart of the islands within him, and he would not abandon his home now. As the Blessed Isles' first nature spirit, he would remain and fight for the soul of the land.\n\nThough surrounded by endless hosts of malicious foes and darkening mist, Maokai fights with furious vengeance to conquer the evil that plagues the isles. His only pleasure comes from dealing savage violence to the soulless wraiths who roam his land.\n\nSome days, Maokai subdues the mist and its deathless spirits, breaking their hold on a grove of trees or a small thicket. Though new life has not bloomed in such cursed soil for an age, Maokai strives to carve havens, however temporary, free from regret and decay.\n\nSo long as Maokai continues to fight, hope remains, for steeped within his heartwood are the uncorrupted waters of life, the last remaining chance of restoring the isles. If the land returns to its joyous state, Maokai, too, will shed his twisted form. The nature spirit brought life to these isles long ago, and he refuses to rest until the isles bloom once more.\n\n;Nightbloom\nThe chill wind whips through cracks in my bark with a hollow whistling sound. I shiver. My limbs have long forgotten the warmth of summer.\n\nThe towering shapes around me fracture and fall in the gale. The lives within died long ago; now they are my silent companions. Their brittle trunks remain only as empty husks, rough gray sketches of the lush forest that once bloomed here.\n\nA spirit weaves between the trees in front of me, pale and spectral against the night air. A knot tightens in my bark. Normally I would lash my roots through its heart, but today I hold still, trying not to alert the wraith to my presence. I am tired of resisting. That I exist at all is an act of defiance against the curse plaguing these lands.\n\nIts moonlike eyes are vacant. There is nothing alive and vulnerable to fuel its cold bitterness on this isle of death, nothing to be hunted or consumed. The spirit slips between the trees, leaving me to my solitude.\n\nI look across the forest of shadows and my branches waver. My gaze catches a tiny flame of red growing amid the endless gray. Nestled in a mound of black dirt, the smallest flower bud pushes up from the ground, its petals so bright they burn my eyes.\n\nIt is a nightbloom. Long ago, they carpeted the floor of the Blessed Isles, blossoming on the evening of the summer solstice. By morning the flowers wilted, leaving only blackened petals, not to be seen again until the following year. But for one night, they illuminated the forest with blazing crimson, as if the very ground was aflame.\n\nI look around and, for a fleeting moment, hope that if one flower exists there might be others. But there is only the somber gray of these dead isles.\n\nMy boughs creak as I take a shaky step forward. I approach the bloom, transfixed, crushing ashen leaves to dust underfoot. My colossal frame towers over its delicate shape. I lean down until my face is inches above the sweet-scented petals. The potent groundwater within my heartwood stirs, awakening in recognition. ''Life.''\n\nThe flower's neck is tilted as if curious. Deep vermillion veins spread across each petal, and its pale green stem is coated with hundreds of silvery, velvet-soft hairs. I could spend eternity basking in its every facet.\n\nEvery moment it grows and shifts in subtle ways; its stem pushing ever higher while its petals slowly unfurl. I am enchanted by each movement, however minute. I watch as the bloom spreads to reveal the filaments extending from within, its heady scent flooding my mind with color. For a moment I forget the cold, the hollow wind, and my own bitterness.\n\nA pale light flickers and I flinch. A glowing shape approaches. My bark tingles. Nothing from these bloodless woods is an ally.\n\nThe cursed spirit is returning, attracted to the lure of movement. Life is not so still as death.\n\nI flex my limbs in fury, no longer eluding violence. I welcome it.\n\nFor one night, a living thing will exist on these barren isles unmarred by corrupt forces.\n\nThe specter races toward the flower and tries to inhale its fragile life. Before the bloom withers into a lifeless shade, I fling {{ai|Sap Magic|Maokai|my limbs}} forward and lash them about the spirit's legs. She screeches, recoiling as if burned, and I roar. The groundwater within me is anathema to such unnatural beings.\n\nShe twists and breaks free of my grasp. I hoist my roots and smash them to the ground. The impact splits the barren topsoil and sends {{ai|Arcane Smash|Maokai|shockwaves}} through the earth. The reverberations strike the wraith and she reels in agony. I laugh bitterly. As she stirs, I sling my limbs through her form and she dissolves.\n\nDusky mist rises from the ground, accompanied by a foul stench. As the wind moans, dozens of spirits materialize before me, their garish faces gaping silently at the scene before them. The nightbloom and I grow before the wall of shadows. I will not let them destroy this one pure thing amongst so much darkness.\n\nI throw all my rage into my blows, driving them back with furious strength. I cannot destroy every spirit on the isles, but I can hold them off for a time. A wraith tries to dart past me. I howl as I lift my roots to pierce its heart, and it dissipates into mist.\n\nMy strength is draining with so many spirits nearby, but I refuse to concede.\n\nThe flower grows brightly beneath the moonlight, oblivious to this battle for its very existence. A single crimson petal falls from its perfect blossom like a drop of blood. The lifecycle of the bloom is near its end, bringing death, and with it, respite. But I do not crave it. I feel I could cleanse the entire island of its scourge in my fury.\n\nThe cursed mist has risen above the treeline and swirls in great clouds. An endless host of spirits pours from the fog, mouths agape with ghoulish hunger. I rise to my greatest height and slam my limbs into the ravenous spirits, shattering one after another into dust. Still, more come.\n\nI howl as I stir the air into a crudely {{ai|Vengeful Maelstrom|Maokai|twisting spiral}}, and nourish the storm with my wrath until it expands in a tempestuous whirlwind. I revel in the chaos as the maelstrom surges in a frenzied circle around me and the flower. It blasts the spirits violently back beyond the trees. From within this nightmare, I have carved a sanctuary where life can grow.\n\nI turn to the flower. We are silent together at the eye of the storm, still amidst the madness. A second fiery petal falls from the nightbloom, then another. My energy drains into the maelstrom, but I do not falter and the tempest rages on. With each passing moment, the blossom droops further until it faces the ground. It is perfect in its slow, natural decay. I cannot look away as it gradually loses its crown of flaming petals and wilts completely.\n\nIt is dead.\n\nI lower my branches and the maelstrom quiets. Above me, the sky is slate gray - as bright as it ever gets in this grim place. The gloom of the mist encroaches once more and the spirits return. Their faces are blank, no longer sensing the illicit life of the nightbloom, no longer anticipating the joy of a fresh kill.\n\nThey retreat into the hollow woods. I whip my roots through a specter as it passes me, scattering its essence into the fading mist. The others edge farther away from me as they return to their gloom.\n\nThough the land appears unchanged, these isles are not the same gray wasteland they were yesterday. The waters of life stir within me and the soil beneath my roots is fertile again.\n\nThough its petals decay into dust, the luminous nightbloom burns fire-bright in my mind, igniting my fury. Just as these islands were born of burning rock, I will cleanse them of their pestilence in a flaming blaze.\n\nI follow the trailing spirits as they slip between hollow trees.\n\nThey will pay for their wickedness.\n\n", "id": 57}, "Thresh": {"key": "Thresh", "name": "Thresh", "title": "the Chain Warden", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Thresh\n|alias = \n* The Chain Warden\n* &lt;s&gt;Brother Thresh&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Flay|Thresh|Scythe}}\n* {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh|Soul Lantern}}\n|render = Thresh Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Specter &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Blessed Isles\n|residence = [[Shadow Isles]]\n|occupation = \n* Soul Jailer\n* &lt;s&gt;Monk of Dusk&lt;/s&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;Artifacts Guardian&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Mordekaiser, Hecarim, Karthus\n|enemies = Lucian, Yorick\n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/thresh?_k=v00djy Chain Warden]\n* [[Shadow and Fortune]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The mind is a wondrous thing to tear apart.&quot;'' - {{ci|Thresh}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSadistic and cunning, Thresh is a restless spirit who prides himself on tormenting mortals and breaking them with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond the point of death, for Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his lantern to torture for all eternity.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nIn an age history has all but forgotten, the man who would later be known as Thresh was once a member of an order devoted to gathering and protecting knowledge. The masters of this order tasked him with guarding a hidden underground vault filled with dangerous and corrupted magical artifacts. Thresh was incredibly strong-willed and methodical, which made him well-suited to such work.\n\nThe vault Thresh guarded was buried deep beneath the citadel at the center of an island chain and protected by runic sigils, arcane locks and potent wards. Spending such time in the presence of dark spells began to affect Thresh as the magic sought out his innate malice. For years the relics preyed on his insecurities, taunting him with his deepest fears and feeding his bitterness.\n\nThresh\u2019s spite surfaced through wanton acts of cruelty, as his talent for exploiting vulnerability bloomed. He slowly tore pages out of a living book, binding it back together when it was all but spent. He scratched the glass of a mirror bound with the memory of an ancient mage until it was opaque, trapping the man in darkness, only to polish it anew and repeat. Just as a secret wants to be told, a spell wants nothing more than to be cast, and Thresh denied this each day. He would start to recite an incantation, then let the words trickle off his tongue, halting just before the last syllable.\n\nHe became exquisitely skilled at covering all evidence of his cruelty, such that no one in the order suspected he was anything other than a disciplined guard. The vault had grown so vast that no one knew its contents as completely as Thresh, and the lesser artifacts faded from the order\u2019s memory, as did Thresh himself.\n\nHe resented that he had to hide his meticulous work. Everything under his watch was evil, or corrupted in some way - why shouldn\u2019t he be free to do as he would?\n\nThe vault held many peculiar magical artifacts but no people, until one day when a chained man was dragged into the sunken catacombs. He was a warlock who had infused his body with raw sorcery, which gave him the power to regenerate his flesh, no matter how grievous the wound.\n\nThresh was delighted at his new ward - a being who could feel the full range of human suffering, but would not perish, a plaything he could torment for years to come. He started methodically separating the warlock\u2019s skin from his flesh with a hook, and used his chains to lash and tear the open wound until it healed. He took to wearing the chains as he patrolled the vault, reveling in the warlock\u2019s fear at the long, dragging sound of his approach.\n\nWith ample charges to torment in the vault, Thresh became even more distanced from the order above. He began to take his meals in his underground chamber lit by a single lantern, rarely emerging from the catacombs. His skin developed a pallid complexion from lack of sunlight, and his face became gaunt and hollow. Members of the order avoided him, and when a series of mysterious disappearances plagued the order, none thought to investigate Thresh\u2019s lair.\n\nWhen the disaster known as the Ruination struck, magical shockwaves claimed the lives of all who lived on the isles and transformed them into a state of undeath. While others screamed in anguish, Thresh reveled in the ruin. He rose from this cataclysm as a spectral abomination, but unlike many who have passed into the shadow world, Thresh did not lose his identity. Rather, his penchant for cruel torture and ability to discern weakness was only heightened.\n\nHe relished the chance to continue his cruelty without fear of reprisal, unfettered by the limits of mortality. As a wraith, Thresh could torment the living and the dead endlessly, delighting in their despair before claiming their soul for an eternity of suffering.\n\nThresh now seeks only particular victims: the most clever and resilient, and those with a strong will. His greatest joy comes from tormenting his victims until they lose any last glimmer of hope, before facing the inevitable hook of his chains.\n\n", "id": 412}, "Kayle": {"key": "Kayle", "name": "Kayle", "title": "The Judicator", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kayle\n|alias = The Judicator\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|Holy Sword}}\n* {{ai|Intervention|Kayle|Holy Magic}}\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nKayle Render.png|Masked\nKayle Unmasked Render.png|Unmasked\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Angel\n|birthplace = \n|residence = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Galio\n|rivals = Morgana\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;In [[the League of Legends]], Justice comes on swift wings.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nIn a world far away where an ancient war still rages, {{ci|Kayle}} was a great heroine - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found.\n\nFor ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly for her people, wielding {{ai|Righteous Fury|Kayle|her flaming sword}} forged before time itself.

A monstrous fusion of man and beast, cursed to ride for eternity, Hecarim revels in {{ai|Rampage|Hecarim|slaughter}} and crushing souls beneath {{ai|Warpath|Hecarim|his armored hooves}}.\n\n==Lore==\nBorn into an empire long since gone to dust and forgotten, Hecarim was squired to a legendary company of knights known as the Iron Order, a brotherhood sworn to defend {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|their king}}'s land. There he endured the harshest training imaginable, a punishing regime that schooled him to be a formidable warrior.\n\nAs Hecarim grew to manhood, he mastered every form of combat and war-stratagem with ease. He quickly outstripped his fellow squires in mounted warfare, and the Knight Commander of the Iron Order saw greatness within the young man and recognized a potential successor. But as the years passed and Hecarim won victory after victory from the back of his mighty warhorse, the Knight Commander finally recognized a growing darkness within his lieutenant. Hecarim's thirst for wholesale slaughter and obsessive hunger for glory was eroding his honor and the Knight Commander knew the young knight must never become the master of the Iron Order. In his private chambers, he told Hecarim that he would not be his successor and though his lieutenant was furious, he bit back on his anger and returned to his duties.\n\nWhen the Order next rode to war, the Knight Commander found himself surrounded by enemies and isolated from his fellow knights. Only Hecarim could ride to his aid, but in a moment of rancor, he turned his mount away and left the Knight Commander to die. At battle's end, the surviving knights, oblivious to what Hecarim had done, knelt on the bloody ground and swore to follow him as their master.\n\nHecarim rode to the capital, and met with {{ci|Kalista}}, the king's general. Kalista recognized his exceptional nature, and when the king's wife was wounded by the poisoned blade of an assassin, she tasked the Iron Order with staying at the king's side while she sought a cure. Hecarim accepted, but being given what he perceived to be a menial task planted a seed of resentment.\n\nHecarim remained with the king as he descended into grief-induced madness. Gripped by paranoia, the king raged at those who sought to separate him from his dying wife and despatched the Iron Order to quell what he saw as dissent throughout his kingdom. Hecarim led the Iron Order in bloody suppressions of discontent, earning a dreadful reputation as a ruthless enforcer of the king's will. Villages burned and the riders of the Iron Order put hundreds to the sword. The kingdom was in darkness, and when the queen died, Hecarim spun falsehoods around the king, speaking of how he had uncovered the truth behind her death, seeking sanction to lead the Iron Order to foreign lands and earn yet more dark renown.\n\nBefore he rode out, Kalista returned from her quest. She had found a cure for the queen's malady upon the legendary Blessed Isles, but was too late to save her. Horrified at what had become of the kingdom, Kalista refused to share what she had discovered and was imprisoned for her defiance.\n\nHecarim saw an opportunity to win yet more favor and visited Kalista's cell. Promising to keep the king from any rash actions, Hecarim persuaded Kalista to reveal what she knew. Kalista reluctantly agreed and guided the king's fleet through the glamours veiling the Blessed Isles from sight.\n\nHecarim led the ruined form of the king to the center of the magical island, where he met with its guardians and demanded their aid. The guardians offered their sympathies, but told the king his wife was beyond their help. Enraged, the king ordered Kalista to kill the guardians one by one until they relented. Kalista refused and stood between the king and the island's inhabitants. Hecarim recognized a crossroads in his life and made a decision that would damn him for eternity. Instead of supporting Kalista, he drove {{ii|The Black Spear|a spear}} through her back and commanded the Iron Order to slay the inhabitants of the Blessed Isles. Hecarim and his warriors slaughtered the guardians until {{ci|Thresh|a lantern-bearing wretch}} finally led the king to what he sought - the secret to resurrecting his wife.\n\nBut when the queen returned to life she was a horror of decayed meat and maggot-ridden flesh who begged to be allowed to die once more. Repulsed at what he had done to his beloved wife, the king enacted a spell to end their lives and bind them together for all eternity. His conjuration was successful, but unwittingly empowered by the many potent magical artifacts stored on the island, its power was increased a hundredfold.\n\n[[The Black Mist|A hurricane of black mist]] surrounded the king, spreading across the island and killing everything it touched. Hecarim abandoned the king to his doom and led the Iron Order back to their ships, killing all in their path as the spirits of those slain by the black mist arose as undying wraiths. One-by-one, the knights were dragged down into undeath until only Hecarim remained. As uncontrolled sorcery filled him, he and his mighty steed were fused together in a monstrous abomination that reflected the true darkness of his soul.\n\nHowling in rage, the titanic beast known as the Shadow of War was wrought in an agonizing transformation, a brazen monster of fury and spite. The sins of his former life were heightened by the maelstrom of dark magic, birthing a creature of endless malice and terrifying power.\n\nNow Hecarim is bound to the Shadow Isles, patrolling its nightmare shores and killing all before him in a mockery of his former duty. And when the Black Mist reaches beyond the Shadow Isles, he and {{ai|Onslaught of Shadows|Hecarim|the spectral host}} of the Iron Order ride with him to slaughter the living in the memory of glories long passed.\n\n;No One Lives\nIcy waves crashed on the bleak shore, red with the blood of the men Hecarim had already butchered. The mortals he had yet to kill were retreating over the beach in terror. Black rain doused them and storm clouds boiled in from the mourning heart of the island. He heard them shouting to one another. The words were a guttural battle-chant he did not recognize, but the meaning was clear; they actually thought they might live to reach their ship. True, they had some skill. They moved as one, wooden shields interlocked. But they were mortal and Hecarim savored the meat-stink of their fear. He circled them, threading crumbling ruins and unseen in the shadowed mist rising from the ashen sand. The echoing thunder of {{ai|Warpath|Hecarim|his hooves}} struck sparks from black rocks. It gnawed at their courage. He watched the mortals through the slitted visor of his helm. The weak light of their wretched spirits was flickering corposant in their flesh. It repulsed him even as he craved it.\n\n''&quot;No-one lives&quot;'', he said.\n\nHis voice was muffled by the dread iron of his helm, like the corpse-rasp of a hanged man. The sound scraped along their nerves like rusted blades. He drank in their terror and grinned as one man threw down his shield and ran for the ship in desperation.\n\nHe bellowed as {{ai|Devastating Charge|Hecarim|he galloped}} from the weed-choked ruins, lowering {{ai|Rampage|Hecarim|his hooked glaive}} and feeling the old thrill of the charge. A memory flickered, riding at the head of a silver host. Winning glory and honor. The memory faded as the man reached the dark surf of cold breakers and looked over his shoulder.\n\n''&quot;Please! No!&quot;'' he cried.\n\nHecarim split him from collarbone to pelvis in one thunderous blow.\n\nHis ebon-bladed glaive pulsed as it bathed in blood. The fragile wisp of the man's spirit sought to fly free, but the mist's hunger would not be cheated. Hecarim watched as the soul was twisted into a dark reflection of the man's life.\n\nHecarim drew the power of the island to him and the bloody surf churned with motion as {{ai|Onslaught of Shadows|Hecarim|a host of dark knights}} wreathed in shimmering light rose from the water. Sealed within archaic plates of ghostly iron, they drew black swords that glimmered with dark radiance. He should know these men. They had served him once and served him still, but he had no memory of them. He turned back towards the mortals on the beach. He parted the mists, reveling in their terror as they saw him clearly for the first time.\n\nHis colossal form was a nightmarish hybrid of man and horse, a chimeric juggernaut of brazen iron. The plates of his body were dark and stamped with etchings whose meanings he only vaguely recalled. Bale-fire smouldered behind his visor, the spirit within cold and dead yet hatefully vital.\n\nHecarim reared as forking traceries of lightning split the sky. He lowered his glaive and led his knights in the charge, throwing up giant clumps of blood-sodden sand and bone fragments as he went. The mortals screamed and brought up their shields, but the ghost-knights charge was unstoppable. Hecarim struck first as was his right as their master, and the thunderous impact splintered the shield wall wide open. Men were trampled to bloody gruel beneath his iron-shod bulk. His glaive struck out left and right, killing with every strike. The ghost knights crushed all before them, slaughtering the living in a fury of thrashing hooves, stabbing lances and chopping blades. Bones cracked and blood sprayed as mortal spirits fled broken bodies, already trapped between life and death by the fell magic of {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|the Ruined King}}.\n\nThe spirits of the dead circled Hecarim, beholden to him as their killer and he reveled in the surging joy of battle. He ignored the wailing spirits. He had no interest in enslaving them.

There, rage is the only fire to warm frozen bones, blood is the only liquid that flows freely, and there is no worse fate than to grow old, frail, and forgotten. Olaf was a warrior of Lokfar with no shortage of glories and no hesitation to share them. While boasting one evening with his clansmen over the burning embers of a razed village, one of the elder warriors grew tired of Olaf's bluster. The old fighter goaded Olaf to read the omens and see if Olaf's fortunes matched his gloating. Emboldened by the challenge, Olaf mocked the aged raider's envy and tossed the knuckle bones of a long-dead beast to predict the heights of glory he'd achieve in death. All mirth left the gathering as the clansmen read the portents: the bones spoke of a long life and a quiet passing.\n\nInfuriated, Olaf stormed into the night determined to prove the prediction false by finding and slaughtering Lokfar's feared frost serpent. The monster had consumed thousands, man and ship alike, in its long lifetime and to die in battle with it would be a fitting end for any warrior. As Olaf hurled himself into the blackness of its maw, he fell deeper into the blackness of his mind. When the shock of freezing water roused him from the dark, there was only the butchered carcass of the beast afloat beside him. Thwarted but not defeated, Olaf set out to hunt down every legendary creature with claws and fangs, hoping that the next battle would be his last. Each time he charged headlong toward his coveted death, only to be spared by the frenzy that washed over him while on its brink.\n\nOlaf concluded that no mere beast could grant him a warrior's death. His solution was to take on the most fearsome tribe in the Freljord: the [[File:ProfileIcon Winter's Claw.png|20px]] '''Winter's Claw'''. {{ci|Sejuani}} appeared amused by Olaf's challenge to her warband, but his audacity would earn him no mercy. She ordered the charge and sent scores of her warriors to overwhelm Olaf. One by one, they fell until he lost himself in the bloodlust once again, effortlessly cutting a path to the leader of the Winter's Claw. The clash between Olaf and Sejuani rocked the glaciers with its force, and though he seemed unstoppable, Sejuani battled the berserker to a standstill. As they stood deadlocked, Sejuani's glare penetrated Olaf's berserker haze in a way no weapon ever could. His frenzy abated long enough for her to make him an offer: Sejuani swore that she would find Olaf his glorious death if he would lend his axe to her campaign of conquest. In that moment, Olaf vowed he would carve his legacy into the Freljord itself.\n\n{{quote|&quot;When you meet your ancestors, tell them Olaf sent you.&quot;|'''Olaf'''}}\n{{clr}}\n", "id": 2}, "Ziggs": {"key": "Ziggs", "name": "Ziggs", "title": "the Hexplosives Expert", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Ziggs\n|alias        = * The Hexplosives Expert\n* Dean Ziggs\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Bouncing Bomb|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Satchel Charge|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Hexplosive Minefield|Ziggs}}\n* {{ai|Mega Inferno Bomb|Ziggs}}\n|render       = [[File:Ziggs Render.png|260px|link=]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation   = * Scientist\n* Inventor\n* Dean of Demolitions\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n* [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Heimerdinger, Rumble\n|rivals       = Tahm Kench\n|related      =\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n{{cbi|Ziggs}} was born with a talent for tinkering, but his chaotic, hyperactive nature was unusual among [[yordle]] scientists. Aspiring to be a revered inventor like {{ci|Heimerdinger}}, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal, emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries. Word of '''Ziggs'''' volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy in [[Piltover]] and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft. His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early conclusion, however, when the hextech engine '''Ziggs''' was demonstrating overheated and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, '''Ziggs''' prepared to return to [[Bandle City]] in shame. However, before he could leave, a group of [[Zaun]]ite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors. The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo them, '''Ziggs''' began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured yordles.\n\nBefore long, '''Ziggs''' had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed &quot;hexplosives&quot;. With his new creations ready for their first trial, '''Ziggs''' traveled to [[Zaun]] and snuck into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced wall. Once the smoke had cleared, '''Ziggs''' scuttled into the facility, sending guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to the Academy, the humbled professors recognized '''Ziggs''' with an honorary title - Dean of Demolitions - and proposed that he demonstrate this new form of yordle ingenuity in [[the League of Legends]]. Vindicated at last, '''Ziggs''' accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to the greatest testing grounds in the world: the [[Fields of Justice]].\n\n{{quote|&quot;{{cbi|Ziggs}}?

With each passing day, her mastery of magical force grows more potent and devastating. Refusing any notion of balance or restraint, Syndra wants only to retain control of her power, even if it means annihilating the [[Ionia#Government|authorities]] that seek to stop her.\n\nThroughout her youth in Ionia, Syndra's reckless use of magic terrified the elders of her village. They took her to a remote temple, leaving her in the care of an old mage. To Syndra's delight, the mage explained that the temple was a school\u2014a place where she could develop her talents under his guidance. Though she learned much during her time there, Syndra no longer felt her power growing as it had in her youth. Her frustration grew, and she finally confronted her mentor, demanding an explanation. He revealed that he had dampened Syndra's magic, hoping to help her learn control and restraint. Accusing him of betrayal, she advanced on the mage, commanding him to lift the spell that was holding her back. He backed away, telling her that if she couldn't control herself, he would be forced to nullify Syndra's magic completely. Furious, she summoned her power and dashed the old man against the walls. With her mentor dead, Syndra felt the rush of her unbounded potential for the first time in years. Though she had won her freedom, she refused to return to the society that had tried to steal her gift. Instead, Syndra decided to claim her former prison as a stronghold. Pushing the boundaries of her magic, she tore the structure from its foundations and raised it into the sky. Free to delve further into her art, Syndra now aims to grow powerful enough to destroy the weak, foolish leaders of Ionia\u2014and anyone else who would dare shackle her greatness.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Power belongs to those who can wield it.&quot;|'''Syndra'''}}\n{{clr}}\n== Quotes ==\n;Upon selection\n* {{sm2|Syndra Select.ogg|''&quot;So much untapped power!&quot;''}}\n\n;Movement\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move1.ogg|''&quot;I am in control.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move2.ogg|''&quot;By force of will.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move3.ogg|''&quot;Let them try to stop me.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move4.ogg|''&quot;My potential is limitless!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move5.ogg|''&quot;A whole world to toy with.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Syndra.move6.ogg|''&quot;More!

After the Pridestalker joins the League, Syndra, the Dark Sovereign, will descend upon the Fields of Justice in the following patch. A magical prodigy, Syndra conjures powerful dark spheres, and even wields enemy minions and monsters as weapons. Here's the full rundown of her abilities:''\n* '''''Transcendent (Passive):''' Each of Syndra's normal abilities gain an extra effect at max rank.''\n** '''''Dark Sphere:''' Spheres deal bonus damage to champions.''\n** '''''Force of Will:''' Projectiles briefly knock enemies into the air.''\n** '''''Scatter the Weak:''' Cone width increases.''\n* '''''Dark Sphere:''' Syndra conjures a dark sphere at a target location, dealing magic damage in an area. The sphere remains for several seconds and can be manipulated by Syndra's other abilities.''\n* '''''Force of Will:'''''\n** '''''First Cast:''' Grabs a target dark sphere, enemy minion or neutral monster.''\n** '''''Second Cast:''' Throw a grasped dark sphere or enemy at a target area. Enemies struck by the projectile take magic damage and are slowed.''\n* '''''Scatter the Weak:''' Deals magic damage in a cone and knocks enemies away based on how close they are to Syndra. Dark spheres within the area of effect are also knocked back, dealing magic damage and stunning enemies in their path.''\n* '''''Unleashed Power (Ultimate):''' Draws upon Syndra's full cataclysmic power, harnessing all active dark spheres to deal additional magic damage to an enemy champion.''\n\n''Syndra's kit revolves around the manipulation of short-duration globes left behind by Dark Sphere. While the function of Dark Sphere is very simple on the surface, proper sphere management can be the difference between success and failure with Syndra. Each of her abilities can be used on its own in a pinch, but good sphere placement ensures that Syndra always has the ammunition she needs to throw projectiles with Force of Will, and creates new firing angles for globes launched with Scatter the Weak.''\n\n''While it might be tempting to snatch up a defenseless minion and use it as a projectile, Syndra's Force of Will ability really shins when it's used in conjunction with dark spheres. Syndra can use Force of Will to reposition these globes for a successful shot with Scatter the Weak while Dark Sphere is on cooldown, or to extend the duration of a sphere that's about to expire in order to build up ammunition on the battlefield. Ultimately, keeping your sphere count high in this manner will allow you to dictate the course of a battle by threatening a large area.''\n\n''The importance of managing your dark spheres is most keenly illustrated by Syndra's ultimate ability, Unleashed Power. The increased damage granted by each active sphere can transform this ability from high-damage nuke into a cataclysmic attack. Good planning and strategic dark sphere placement can make Syndra an intimidating opponent to face in mid lane.''\n\n''* Syndra's ability to clear minion waves from long range and put out a ton of burst damage got to be a bit much when combined with her substantial complement of crowd control abilities. Ultimately, we decided that the slow from Force of Will combined with the stun and knockback of Scatter the Weak gave her a problematic amount of disruption potential for the amount of damage she was doing. To solve this, we lowered the base slow on Force of Will and tweaked the added effect from her passive. Instead of knocking opponents into the air, you\u2019ll now get an increase in your slow\u2019s duration when Force of Will reaches Rank 5.''\n\n=== Syndra Now Available ===\nBy '''NeeksNaman'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2570363 Syndra, the Dark Sovereign, Now Available]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n''Today, Syndra, the Dark Sovereign, brings her powerful force magic to bear against her enemies on the Fields of Justice.

By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.\n\nDr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer, an accomplishment that [[Noxus]] noticed. The empire was impressed by his ambition, and recruited his talents to initiate a relationship between the two nations.\n\nHe continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking. There are rumors that the High Command in Noxus has given him free reign to pursue his life's work in his spare time.\n\n", "id": 36}, "Karma": {"key": "Karma", "name": "Karma", "title": "the Enlightened One", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Karma\n|alias = The Enlightened One\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Inner Flame|Karma|Spirit Energy}}\n* {{ai|Mantra|Karma|Mantle of Decorum}}\n|render = Karma Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Navori, [[Ionia]]\n|residence = The Placidium, [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Elder\n* Spiritual Leader\n|faction = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Irelia, Lee Sin\n|enemies = Syndra\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Your spirit is something no one can take from you.

A strong leader torn between tradition and revolution, Karma seeks to protect the peace of Ionia - by force if necessary.\n\nKarma once lived a tranquil life in a small Ionian village. Led by elder monks, the villagers practiced a tradition of benevolent magic and pacifism. Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\n\nHer inner peace was tested when the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded Ionia. While the village's elder monks insisted their peaceful ways would spare them from violence, Karma had heard enough tales of Noxian cruelty to openly question the elders' wisdom. Stern and unmoving, they told her to trust in tradition.\n\nWhen the invaders marched on the village, the elder monks rode out to negotiate a bloodless end to the battle. The Noxian general was offended by their show of weakness and slaughtered the monks himself as he ordered his soldiers to strike the village.\n\nAs the Noxians advanced, the villagers prepared to accept death, bound to their peaceful vows. But Karma would not accept death and instead saw another way: sacrificing a single life to spare many others.\n\nTo save her people, she drew upon {{ai|Mantra|Karma|the power within}} and summoned the full force of her will. {{ai|Soulflare|Karma|A burst of spirit fire}} emerged from her body and spiraled towards the Noxian general.\n\nThe flame took the form of {{ai|Gathering Fire|Karma|twin dragons}}, the symbol of Ionia itself. It was the first time Karma had ever used her powers to harm instead of protect, and neither she nor the villagers had ever seen anything like it.\n\nWhen the magic subsided, the general had fallen before her and his soldiers had scattered. The opposing forces surrendered to Karma's strength leaving her people, and their traditions, untouched.\n\nWhile the war raged on, Karma became a formidable leader of the Ionian resistance, but the conflict did not end when Noxus' armies fled the Ionian shores.\n\nIonia became divided between the resistance fighters who craved vengeance and the monks who demanded a return to spiritual tradition. Karma saw a third path, one that combined the strength Ionia found in war with the peaceful traditions the nation still held dear.\n\nShe now seeks to return her ravaged land to an enduring peace.\n\n", "id": 43}, "Annie": {"key": "Annie", "name": "Annie", "title": "the Dark Child", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Annie\n|real_name = Annie Hastur\n|alias = The Dark Child\n|weapon_pet = {{moi|Tibbers}}\n|render = Annie Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|residence = [[Voodoo Lands]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* The Grey Order\n|allies = \n|friends = Amumu\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\nThere have always been those within [[Noxus]] who did not agree with the evils perpetrated by the [[Noxian]] High Command.

Both a warrior and a mystic, Volibear seeks to defend the ancient ways and the warrior spirit of his tribe.\n\nThough history recorded their once legendary feats in battle, the Ursine now lived in tranquil seclusion. The warriors were headed by a triumvirate of leaders who maintained a long-lived isolation, avoiding the petty affairs and conflicts of others. As shaman to the three, Volibear was a respected sage known for his insight. It was an era of unprecedented peace, but Volibear felt dread stirring within him. Prosperity was turning the tribe soft and weak, and many had long forgotten the sacred art of war. In time, Volibear felt the fire of their souls would be extinguished. When he revealed his misgivings to the triumvirate, they refused to listen and warned him to know his place.\n\nSeeking wisdom, Volibear undertook a perilous climb to the peak of the Ursine's sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. The eye of the storm was said to bestow portents, and legend held that the tempest would mark the next great chieftain of the tribe. As Volibear ascended the peak, he was struck by an unnatural bolt of lightning. When the shaman awoke, he was possessed by a horrific vision of the Freljord utterly consumed by darkness. Volibear saw an unprepared and complacent Ursine force slaughtered by [[Watcher|terrible creatures of ice]]. In an instant, he knew his race would perish if they did not prepare for war.\n\nVolibear rushed down the mountainside to recount what he had seen, but found the path blocked by three Ursine - the triumvirate. Knowing he would end the lasting peace, they refused to heed Volibear's warning and demanded his silence, by his word - or his death. Resolute and adamant, Volibear swore that the Ursine's very survival depended on his message, and launched into ferocious combat against the three. A terrible clash ensued, and just as Volibear succumbed to his opponents, he {{ai|Thunder Claws|Volibear|called upon}} the power of the maelstrom. Unleashing raw lightning, he struck the trio down with a thunderous blow. Stunned and astonished, the triumvirate beheld the sign of Ursine leadership: the force of the sacred storm.\n\nRecognizing his foretold ascendance, the triumvirate appointed Volibear as the Ursine's new leader. His influence was swift and decisive: he roused his tribe from complacency, revived their battle-hardened traditions, and allied with {{ci|Sejuani}}, the warrior who would fight with them against {{ci|Lissandra|the coming evil}}. With time, the tribe grew lean and fierce, becoming known again as fearsome warriors of legend.

With the world turned against him, he will do everything in his power to bring the guilty to justice and restore his honor.\n\nOnce a brilliant pupil at a renowned [[Ionia]]n sword school, Yasuo was the only student in a generation to master the legendary wind technique. Many believed he was destined to become a great hero. However, his fate was changed forever when [[Noxus]] invaded. Yasuo was charged with guarding an Ionian Elder, but, foolishly believing his blade alone could make the difference, left his post to join the fray. By the time he returned, the Elder had been slain.\n\nDisgraced, Yasuo willingly turned himself in, prepared to pay for his failure with his life. He was shocked, however, to find himself accused not just of dereliction, but of the murder itself. Though confused and racked with guilt, he knew the assassin would go unpunished if he did not act. Yasuo raised his sword against the school and fought his way free, knowing his treason would turn all of Ionia against him. Now truly alone for the first time in his life, he set out to find the Elder's real killer.\n\nYasuo spent the next several years wandering the land, seeking any clue that might lead him to the murderer. All the while, he was relentlessly hunted by his former allies, continually forced to fight or die. His mission drove him ever forward, until he was tracked down by the one foe he dreaded most \u2013 his own brother, Yone.\n\nBound by a common code of honor, the two warriors bowed and drew their swords. Silently they circled one another under the moonlight. When they finally charged forward, Yone was no match for Yasuo; with a single flash of steel he cut his brother down. Yasuo dropped his weapon and rushed to Yone's side.\n\nOvercome with emotion, he demanded to know how his own kin could think him guilty. Yone spoke: \u201cThe Elder was killed by a wind technique. Who else could it be?\u201d Understanding swept over Yasuo as he suddenly realized why he had been accused. He professed his innocence once more and begged his brother's forgiveness. Tears streamed down Yasuo's face as his brother passed in his arms.\n\n[[File:Yasuo.png|right|250px]] Yasuo buried Yone under the rising sun, but could take no time to mourn. Others would be after him before long. His brother's revelation had given Yasuo newfound purpose; he now had the clue that would lead to the true killer. Swearing an oath, he gathered his belongings and, with one last look at Yone's grave, set out with the wind at his back.\n\n{{quote|''&quot;The story of a sword is inked in blood.&quot;''| '''Yasuo'''}}\n\n{{quote|{{sm2|Yasuo.login.ogg|''&quot;A lot of people want me dead - they call it justice.

Along its perimeter, he mounted the skulls of his slain prey - a warning to would-be aggressors.\n\nHe thought undisputed reign of a region would fulfill him, but instead, he grew restless. No beasts in his domain proved challenging prey, and without formidable adversaries to push his limits, Rengar's spirit waned. He feared that no worthwhile game remained, that he would never again feel the {{ai|Thrill of the Hunt|Rengar}}.

Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes - fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these glyphs before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.\n\n==Lore==\nRyze was just {{csl|Ryze|Young|a young man}} when he first learned of the powerful arcane forces that lay hidden across the world. While on a diplomatic mission, Ryze overheard his master, Tyrus, in discussion with another wizened old mage. In hushed tones, they spoke of the potential danger of something called 'World Runes'. As Tyrus noticed his pupil, he abruptly ended the conversation, tightly clutching the scroll that never left his side.\n\nOver the following decades, knowledge of the Runes began to spread as more were unearthed. The world's brightest minds studied the ancient glyphs, attempting to determine the powers they possessed. Few could even begin to understand the importance of their origins, or the sheer power held within them. Some surmised that the Runes were integral to the creation of Runeterra itself. The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such 'Makers' Might' being used as a weapon.\n\nRyze and Tyrus traveled between various nations, trying to quell paranoia and encourage restraint, but their missions became increasingly precarious. Relentlessly, they strove to avert multiple disasters, but Ryze could sense his master's growing desperation.\n\nTyrus' worst fears were realized when he and his student were mediating a standoff between two warring nations, not far from Ryze's boyhood village of Khom. Each army accused the other of plotting to use runic weapons against the other, and each was prepared to do the same in self-defense. As tensions grew out of control, Tyrus could see it was a conflict he could not mediate. With the two sides determined to go to war, he could do nothing but flee with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nThey had escaped halfway across a mountain range before the battle erupted. Ryze suddenly felt the earth fall away beneath him. The ground seemed to retch and squeal, while the sky above them recoiled as if mortally wounded. Tyrus grabbed Ryze and screamed unheard commands, but the words were swallowed by the unnatural silence around them. For the first time, they were witnessing the effects of two World Runes at war.\n\nSeconds later, reality settled. Ryze and Tyrus clambered to the ruins of a nearby peak and looked back upon the valley where the two armies previously stood. Below, they saw insanity - destruction so massive that it defied all physical sense. The armies, the people, the very land itself were gone. An ocean that was previously beyond a day's journey was now rushing to meet them. Ryze could only fall to his knees and stare into the great hole left in the world. The devastation was complete. Nothing remained. Not even the village he once called home.\n\nOpen warfare raged across Runeterra. The first horrors of the Rune Wars sparked fear and aggression among those who now realized the power at their command. Even Ryze felt the urge to join the conflict to prevent further devastation of the kind unleashed on his people. Tyrus was there to stay the hand of his pupil, counseling that the path of vengeance would lead only to more heartache. Ryze was initially vexed by his master's words, but he soon came to accept Tyrus' wisdom.\n\nTraveling across the world to meet with those who held the Runes, Tyrus pleaded for sanity. To ensure the future of Runeterra, he asked that every World Rune be locked away beyond the reach of man. Deeply sobered by the imminent threat of annihilation, some agreed to turn over their World Runes to Tyrus, while others refused to cast aside their newfound power and influence.\n\nTyrus continued his work, attempting to remove all World Runes from the reach of humanity. Yet as hope for Runeterra grew, Tyrus seemed to unravel. Ryze saw his master grow more distant. While Tyrus dealt with the Runes, he began to send his student on missions that seemed to have little importance.\n\nRyze was on one such menial errand when he received word of a new cataclysm, this time to the southwest of [[Valoran]], in [[Icathia]]. The mage rushed to the scene of the devastation, beset with concern for his master and friend, hoping that he had survived. Upon his arrival, Ryze was elated to find that Tyrus was indeed safe. But Ryze's relief was short-lived. Next to the scroll he had never been allowed to read, sat two World Runes.\n\nThe older mage explained that once the World Runes were in play, he had no choice but to use them himself. Ryze was horrified as he realized Tyrus had not just survived the disaster, he had caused it. He continued his bitter tirade, telling his student that humanity was a reckless child, playing with power it did not understand. Tyrus could no longer play the role of diplomat for ignorant power-mongers. He had to stop them.\n\nThough Ryze tried to reason with Tyrus, it was no use. The infinitely wise paragon he'd looked up to since childhood was gone. Before him stood a flawed man, susceptible to the same temptations as the fools he decried. The Runes had corrupted him deeply, and he was sure to use them again and again, taking more of the world away each time.\n\nRyze had to act, even if it meant destroying his only true friend. He unleashed every ounce of {{ai|Overload|Ryze|arcane energy}} he could muster. Tyrus reached for the Runes, determined not to relinquish their power. In grasping for them, the corrupted mage had left himself momentarily defenseless to Ryze's onslaught. A moment later, Tyrus' corpse lay smoldering on the floor.\n\nRyze trembled with emotion as his mind struggled to process what he had done.\n\nAs he regained his senses, he found himself alone with the World Runes, their glow inviting him to possess them. Steeling himself, he picked up the strange symbols one by one, and immediately felt them transforming him into something greater, or more terrible, than he could ever otherwise be.\n\nShuddering, he dropped the Runes and backed away. If these glyphs could corrupt a mage with the strength and integrity of Tyrus, how was Ryze to handle them?\n\nHe then realized that if he walked away, someone else would find the Runes and use them. At that moment, Ryze understood the scale of his task. As long as any World Rune remained in play, the Rune Wars would continue and surely doom all Runeterra.\n\nUnsure what possible next step to take, Ryze saw the scroll Tyrus always carried with him. Tentatively, Ryze unfurled the scroll and was illuminated by a radiant glow. Suddenly, Ryze knew what he must do.\n\n[[File:Ryze_Runebody.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nEver since that day, Ryze has wandered the world, driven by the same unseen beckoning that both guides and terrifies him. He constantly rejects the promise of power within each Rune, choosing instead to bind them in secret locations {{ai|Realm Warp|Ryze|no one can access}}. He has spent centuries performing the task, his life abnormally prolonged by the magic he has absorbed carrying out his duty. Even after all this time, Ryze cannot afford to slow. The World Runes have begun to emerge once more, and the world has forgotten the price of wielding them.\n\n", "id": 13}, "Shen": {"key": "Shen", "name": "Shen", "title": "the Eye of Twilight", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Shen\n|alias = \n* Eye of Twilight\n* Master Shen\n|weapon_pet = \n* Ionian Steel Saber\n* {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|Spirit Blade}}\n|render = Shen Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Eye of Twilight\n* Kinkou Leader\n* Material and Spirit World Avatar\n* &lt;small&gt;(Surgeon {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* [[Kinkou Order]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Kennen, Akali\n|rivals = Zed\n|enemies = Jhin\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The Eye is blind to fear, to hate, to love - to all things that would sway equilibrium.&quot;'' - {{ci|Shen}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLeader of a secret clan of mystic warriors, Shen serves as the Eye of Twilight, entrusted to enforce equilibrium in the world. Longing to remain free from the confusion of emotion, prejudice, or ego, Shen continually struggles, {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|spirit blade}} in hand, to walk the unseen path of dispassionate judgment.\n\n==Lore==\nAn enigma to the shadowy realm of the spirits, as well as the mortal territories of man, Shen belongs to neither. Within him exists an uneasy fusion of human soul and arcane power. He is seen by both sides as someone to be feared. He is immovable. He is constant. He answers to nothing but his purpose.\n\nAlthough his birth within the most revered of [[Ionia]]n clans marked him as destined to serve, it was his iron will that made Shen the chosen leader of [[Kinkou Order|a shadowed order]]. Wielding his {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|spirit blade}} \u2013 the symbol of his duty, as well as his connection to the spirit realm - Shen roams both worlds, unerringly drawn to any place where one side threatens to overwhelm the other.\n\nThere are countless legends recounting Shen's battles across the realms. From his innumerable clashes with the Seven Demon Clan throughout Ionia's physical and ethereal planes to Shen's brutal scourging of the loathsome skin devourers from the Black Steppes of the [[Freljord]], the truth is lost among the tales told in his wake.\n\nOne of the most fanciful stories recounted by Ionians is of the day Shen suddenly appeared in the central court of [[Noxus]]. Standing in the very heart of his enemy's stronghold, onlookers watched in rapt horror as he appeared to fight a terrible battle against a threat they could not see. To the crowd, Shen seemed to flash in and out of existence, wounds blossoming all over his body from nowhere. Unknown to the Noxians, he singlehandedly defended their entire empire from an incursion by the spirit world.\n\nThough Shen walks a lonely path on both this plane and beyond, he does not always walk alone. Other members of his hidden sect - the mortal shadow warrior, {{ci|Akali}}, and the lightning-quick [[yordle]], {{ci|Kennen}} - always stand ready to assist him.\n\nThough he has allies, Shen is solely entrusted with his father's blade and the responsibility it carries. The Eye of Twilight is forbidden from allowing passion to sway his judgement. While he still unswervingly executes his duty, Shen struggles to contain his anger over the murder of his father at the hands of {{ci|Zed}}, a man he once considered his brother.\n\nWith the fate of the world of men, as well as the spirit realm, resting on his shoulders, Shen struggles to maintain the balance between his human emotions and his spiritual focus. How long can one man balance two worlds on the edge of a blade?\n\n;True Neutral\n''&quot;It was no tempest. It was a spirit&quot;'', said the fisherman, still rattled by the shipwreck he'd barely survived two nights ago. The man told of his fishing vessel being sunk by a creature, large as a house and quick as the wind.\n\nShen listened to the tale, silently weighing the facts as presented.\n\n''&quot;Show me where it happened&quot;'', said Shen.\n\nThe man led him to a beach in the bay, where a team of villagers worked to recover the drowned bodies of the mariners. Shen knelt to examine a piece of wreckage. The gashes in the driftwood were deep and savage, the work of powerful claws.\n\n''&quot;How many dead?&quot;'' he asked. ''&quot;All but me... Six&quot;'', responded the fisherman.\n\n''The spirits are strong'', thought Shen, digging through the wreckage for any further evidence.\n\nAt last, on the edge of a splintered portion of the hull, he found it: a small tuft of gossamer hair. Most people would overlook it, or if they did see it, they'd never believe a creature that could break a ship in half could leave something so delicate. But Shen had seen hair like this before. Any doubts he'd had about the veracity of the fisherman's tale faded as he watched the fine, silvery tuft dissolve into nothing at his touch.\n\n''&quot;A demon&quot;'', Shen remarked. ''&quot;You must have sailed into its path.&quot;''\n\nThe fisherman nodded grimly. Spirits of all kinds were known to mingle with the physical world, especially in Ionia, where the barrier between realms was thin and passable. The ethereal and material planes were in constant contact, sliding peacefully past one another like oil atop water.\n\nAs the Eye of Twilight, it was Shen's duty to walk between the worlds, ensuring neither side overwhelmed the other. To humans, he was a ghost, vanishing in the space between breaths to reappear many miles away. To spirits, he was a human, flesh and bone who ought never to venture into ethereal realms.\n\nHe knelt on the beach to examine one of the corpses that had been recovered. The man had been torn in half, just below the ribs. What was left of his innards dangled from a pale, bloated torso.\n\n''&quot;You need not worry. I shall have the monster before nightfall&quot;'', said a voice from behind.\n\nShen turned to see a holy man sent by the local temple. Several acolytes stood around him, carrying an assortment of mystical trinkets and oils. They were beginning a cleansing ritual to root out any spiritual disturbances in the area. The holy man stared at Shen, as if sizing up his value.\n\n''&quot;Can we count on your help, sir?&quot;'' the man asked.\n\n''&quot;Balance will be restored&quot;'', said Shen with an assuring nod.\n\nHe parted ways with the holy man and continued to follow the faint trail of gossamer hair. He thought of the dead seafarers and the cost he'd need to exact from the demon. The words of his father still rang true: ''&quot;The hardest part is finding the point of balance in all things.&quot;'' True neutrality, the precise center of all forces at work in the world - that is what the Eye must be able to distinguish.\n\nEnforcing that equilibrium was its own struggle. For the task, Shen carried two blades on his back. One was an Ionian steel saber that could cleave through a person in one blow. The other was {{ai|Twilight Assault|Shen|a sword of pure arcane energy}}. It was used for dealing with spirits, and had been passed down through many generations of Shen's ancestors. He had slain countless demons, ghosts, wraiths, and sprites with it over the years, and fully expected to take one more before the day was done.\n\nAt last, Shen came to a secluded inlet, quiet and devoid of human activity. On a sandbar in the shallows lay the demon, its fine, glossy coat shimmering in the dusk. The creature swelled as it rested, engorged from consuming the mortal essences of its victims. Shen crept through the rushes, silently edging toward the sleeping demon. He could see its massive ribcage expand and contract with deep, restful breaths. When he was but a few paces from the sandbar, he drew his spirit blade, readying his strike.\n\nSuddenly, a distressing sound stayed his hand. It was a shrill, ghastly cry, emanating from the very air itself. It sounded familiar, but before Shen could identify the noise, he heard it again. And again. And again, culminating in a chorus of blood-curdling shrieks. These were the cries of dying spirits. Shen's eyes darted back to the demon, now beginning to stir from its slumber. Shen took one more look at his spirit blade, calmly weighing his options. He then clasped his hands together, carefully focusing his [[File:Stand United Shield.png|20px|link=]] ki, and disappeared in {{ai|Stand United|Shen|a vortex of crackling energy}}, leaving the demon alone on its sandbar.\n\nA moment later, Shen reappeared at the site of the shipwreck.  All around, smoldering pools of black ooze evaporated into the air, coupled with the lingering reek of terror.\n\nShen counted the dissipating black puddles, each the remains of a slain spirit. His tally was interrupted as the holy man entered the clearing with his acolytes. One of the men held a cord of flax and silver. Tethered to the other end was a smaller spirit - an imp of no significance. It struggled against the choke of its leash. It wailed as it saw the remains of its brethren.\n\n''&quot;Would you care to dispose of this one?&quot;'' the holy man asked Shen, casually, as if offering him a bowl of soup at dinner.\n\nShen looked at the sticky, smoldering pools that were mighty beings of the otherworld just moments ago. Then he turned his gaze toward the priest and the wailing imp.\n\n''&quot;I am sorry for this, Your Holiness&quot;'', he said. He placed his spirit blade back into its scabbard and drew his steel saber instead. It was not the sword he had expected to use that day.\n\n", "id": 98}, "Zac": {"key": "Zac", "name": "Zac", "title": "the Secret Weapon", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zac\n|alias      = * The Secret Weapon \n|render     = [[File:Zac Render.png|200px|link=]]\n|gender     = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race       = Artificial Lifeform\n|birthplace = [[Zaun]]\n|residence  = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation = * [[Zaun]]ite Hero\n|friends    = Twitch\n|faction    = * [[Zaun]] &lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|related    = \n}}\n", "background": "== Lore ==\n[[File:Zac_picture_1.png|thumb|left]]\nZac is the product of a [[Zaun]] experiment to manufacture a hexchem-engineered supersoldier \u2013 the Zaun Amorphous Combatant. Combining brute strength with limitless flexibility, he is a versatile juggernaut: a creative fighter who bounces over obstacles and pounds his foes into submission. Though he was created inside a weapons laboratory, Zac was rescued and adopted by two loving parents who raised him to be a kind and friendly child. As the years passed, he grew up to be a fierce hero, sworn to protect the ordinary, everyday people of Zaun.\n\nLong ago, two Zaun scientists developed an organic substance that could withstand extreme conditions, spontaneously alter its biological structure, and generate tremendous amounts of kinetic force. As the scientists, husband and wife, watched the prototype grow from a spoon-sized droplet to a small blob, they noticed that their creation would respond to their presence. It sprung forward when they called and bounced when they sang. The couple began to see more than an experiment; they saw a small child, filled with affection and joy.\n\nAfter testing the prototype one evening, the scientists placed the blob back in its cage. It slouched and shuddered in the corner, inconsolably sad. At that moment, the couple realized that their beloved creation wished for a free life outside the lab. They were struck by their conscience and could not allow the prototype to be used as a weapon. The husband and wife fled with the young blob, replacing its weapon designation \u2013 Zaun Amorphous Combatant \u2013 with a proper name: Zac. In a quiet neighborhood far from the cities of Zaun, the scientists raised Zac as their own child.\n\n[[File:Zac picture 2.png|thumb|150px]]\nZac was always different from the other children. None had his powers of strength and flexibility, so the couple taught him to tell right from wrong and to use his gifts responsibly. Thanks to the care and affection of his loving parents, Zac lived a peaceful, happy childhood.\n\nThat childhood ended when the Zaun laboratory finally found Zac. Unable to replicate the formula used to create the amorphous prototype, the laboratory's staff never stopped searching for the scientists and their experiment. When they tracked down the family, they threatened to tear it apart. The staff abducted Zac's parents and demanded that the couple assist in his capture and return. Seized by the fear of losing his freedom and his parents, Zac unleashed every ounce of his raw energy and mass for the very first time. He subdued his parents' captors, sent the laboratory's workers fleeing, and brought his loved ones home. From then on, Zac vowed to defend all ordinary lives threatened by extraordinary treachery and wickedness. Originally built to destroy, he now protects the innocent and the helpless.\n[[File:Zac quote.png|thumb|center|570px]]\n", "id": 154}, "Talon": {"key": "Talon", "name": "Talon", "title": "the Blade's Shadow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Talon\n|alias = The Blade's Shadow\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Noxian Diplomacy|Talon|Arm Blade}}\n* {{ai|Rake|Talon|Circular Daggers}}\n* {{ai|Shadow Assault|Talon|Double-Edged Blades}}\n|render = Talon Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Assassin\n* &lt;s&gt;Thief&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Katarina\n|rivals = Quinn\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The three deadliest blademasters in all of [[Valoran]] are bound to the house of Du Couteau: my father, myself, and {{ci|Talon}}.

According to them, Swain limped into the ward without cry or complaint: his right leg was snapped in half, with bone protruding from the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain\u2019s measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor\u2019s recommendation of magical treatment for the leg\u2019s inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in documents from the Noxian military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus\u2019 proud legion, but the records indicate his first designation was that of a ranking officer.\n\nThe men who've served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command's hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. A cunning strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the [[Ionia]]n Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion. If Swain was upset by the events which unfolded, he never believed it. His face was so implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something utterly inhuman beneath. More controversy surrounded the bird that never left his shoulder, whose name he whispered only to it.

Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the ancient empire of Shurima to greatness for many centuries. After the fall of the empire, he went into self-imposed exile, becoming little more than a legend. Now that the ancient city of Shurima has risen once more, he has returned, determined to ensure it never falls again.\n\n==Lore==\nNasus' brilliance was recognized from a young age, long before he was chosen to join the ranks of the Ascended. A voracious scholar, he read, memorized and critiqued the greatest works of history, philosophy, and rhetoric within the Library of the Sun before he'd seen ten summers. His passion for reading and critical thinking were not passed down to his younger brother {{ci|Renekton}}, who was quickly bored, and spent his time fighting with other local children. The brothers were close, and Nasus kept a protective eye over his younger brother, helping to ensure he didn't get into too much trouble. However, it wasn't long before Nasus was welcomed into the exclusive Collegium of the Sun, leaving home to take up his place in this prestigious academy.\n\nWhile the pursuit of knowledge would always be his passion, Nasus' grasp on military strategy and logistics ensured he became the youngest general in Shuriman history. While he was a competent soldier, his genius lay not in fighting battles, but in planning them.\n\nHis strategic foresight became legendary. In war, he was always a dozen moves ahead of the enemy, able to predict their movement and reactions, as well as pinpoint the exact moment to push the attack or pull back. A deeply empathetic man who took his responsibilities incredibly seriously, he always ensured his soldiers were well provisioned, paid on time, and treated fairly. Every loss of life pained him deeply, and he often refused to rest as he planned and replanned his troop movements and battle dispositions until they were perfect. He was loved and respected by all who served in his legions, and he guided the armies of Shurima to countless victories. His brother Renekton often served on the front lines of these wars, and the two of them quickly garnered an aura of invincibility.\n\nDespite the acclaim Nasus won, he did not enjoy war. Though he understood its importance - for now at least - in ensuring the continued progress of the empire, he firmly believed his greatest contribution to Shurima was in the knowledge he gathered for future generations.\n\nAt Nasus' urging, all the books, scrolls, teachings and histories of the cultures he defeated were preserved in great libraries and repositories throughout the empire, the greatest of which bore his name. His hunger for knowledge was not for selfish reasons, but to share wisdom with all of Shurima, to enhance understanding of the world and bring enlightenment to the empire.\n\nAfter decades of dutiful service, Nasus was cruelly struck down by a terrible wasting sickness. Some say he encountered {{ci|Amumu}}, a long-dead child-king said to bear {{ai|Cursed Touch|Amumu|a terrible curse}}; others believed he was laid low by the evil magicks of an [[Icathia]]n cult-leader. Whatever the truth, the emperor's own physician declared, with a heavy heart, that Nasus was incurable, and would be dead within a week.\n\nThe people of Shurima went into mourning, for Nasus was its brightest star and beloved by all. The emperor himself begged the priesthood for an augury. After a day and night of communing with the divine, the priests declared it the will of the sun-god that Nasus be blessed with the Ascension ritual.\n\nRenekton, now a great war-leader, raced back to the capital to be with his brother. The terrible sickness had advanced dramatically, and Nasus was little more than a skeleton, his flesh wasted away and his bones as fragile as glass. So weak was he that as the golden light from the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} streamed onto the Ascension dais, Nasus was unable to climb the final stairs and step into the light.\n\nRenekton's love for his brother was stronger than any sense of self-preservation, and he nobly bore Nasus onto the dais. Ignoring his brother's protests, he willingly accepted oblivion in order to save Nasus. However, Renekton was not destroyed, as was expected. When the light faded, two Ascended beings stood before Shurima. Both brothers had been deemed worthy, and the emperor himself dropped to his knees to give thanks to the divine.\n\nNasus was now a towering, jackal-headed being of great strength, his eyes glittering with fierce intelligence, while Renekton had been transformed into a heavily muscled behemoth bearing the likeness of a crocodile. They took their place alongside the other rare Ascended beings of Shurima, and became its protectors.\n\nWhile Renekton had always been a great warrior, now he was virtually unstoppable. Nasus too had been gifted with powers far beyond the understanding of mortal men. The greatest boon of his Ascension - his newly extended longevity, which allowed him countless lifetimes to spend in study and contemplation - would, after the fall of Shurima, also prove to be his curse.\n\nOne side-effect of the ritual that disturbed Nasus was the increased {{ai|Reign of Anger|Renekton|savagery}} he saw within his brother. At the culmination of the siege of Nashramae, which finally brought that ancient city under Shuriman rule, Nasus witnessed the victorious Shuriman soldiers butchering everyone they came across and setting the city ablaze. Renekton led the massacre, and it was he who set fire to the great library of Nashramae, destroying countless irreplaceable volumes before Nasus was able to contain it. This was the closest the brothers ever came to bloodshed, standing in the center of the city, weapons drawn against each other. Under the stern, disappointed gaze of his brother, Renekton's bloodlust waned, and he finally turned away in shame.\n\nOver the following centuries, Nasus bent his every effort to learning all he could, scouring the desert for years in search of ancient artifacts and wisdom, eventually going on to discover the legendary Tomb of the Emperors hidden beneath the Shuriman capital.\n\nNasus and Renekton had both been lured away when the Ascension ritual of Emperor {{ci|Azir}} went terribly wrong, the young emperor betrayed by his closest advisor, the magus {{ci|Xerath}}. The brothers returned as fast as they could, but were too late. Azir was dead, along with most of the capital's citizens. Filled with rage and grief, Nasus and Renekton battled the malevolent being of pure energy that Xerath had become.\n\nUnable to kill Xerath, they sought to bind him in {{ai|Mana Surge|Xerath|a magical sarcophagus}}, but even that was not enough to hold him. Renekton, perhaps attempting to atone for Nashramae years earlier, grabbed Xerath and bore him into the Tomb of the Emperors, bidding Nasus seal them in. Nasus refused, desperate to find another way, but there was no other option. With a heavy heart, he sealed Xerath and his brother within the fathomless darkness, locking them away for all eternity.\n\nThe Shuriman empire collapsed. Its great central city sank into ruin, and the holy {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} fell from the sky, drained of power by Xerath's magic. Without it, the divine waters flowing from the city ran dry, bringing death and famine to Shurima.\n\nBearing the heavy burden of guilt for having damned his brother to darkness, Nasus took to roaming the sands, accompanied only by the ghosts of the past and his grief. A melancholy figure, he stalked the now dead cities of Shurima, watching as they were slowly swallowed by the desert, lamenting the fallen empire and its lost people. He embraced isolation, a lean, solitary nomad who the occasional traveler claimed to glimpse before he disappeared into a sandstorm or an early morning haze. Few believed such stories, and Nasus became little more than a legend.\n\nCenturies passed, and Nasus all but forgot his old life and former purpose, until the moment when the now buried Tomb of the Emperors was rediscovered, and its seal broken. In that moment, he knew Xerath was free.\n\nAncient vigor stirred in his breast, and as Shurima rose from the sands, Nasus traversed the desert, angling toward the newly reborn city. Though he knew he had to battle Xerath once more, hope stirred within him for the first time in millennia. Not only was this potentially the dawn of a new Shuriman empire, but he dared believe it might also herald a long-awaited reunion with his beloved brother.\n\n;Ouroboros\n{{ci|Nasus}} walked at night, unwilling to face the sun. The boy followed in his wake.\n\n''How long had he been there?''\n\nThose mortals who caught a glimpse of the monstrous vagabond always ran, all save the boy. Together, they wove a path through the bygone tapestry of [[Shurima]]. Self-imposed isolation chipped at Nasus' consciousness. The desert wind howled around their malnourished frames.\n\n''&quot;Nasus, look, above the dune sea&quot;'', said the child.\n\nStars guided the pair's sojourn across the desiccated expanse. The old jackal no longer wore the armor of the [[Ascended]]. The golden monuments lay buried with the past. Now a hermit dressed in tattered fabric, Nasus scratched at his matted fur before slowly raising his head to observe the night sky.\n\n''&quot;The Piper&quot;'', said Nasus, his voice low and graveled. ''&quot;The season will change soon.&quot;''\n\nNasus put a hand on the boy's tiny shoulder and looked down into his sunburnt face. There, he saw the soft lines and curves of Shuriman lineage, worn ragged by travel.\n\n''When did it become your place to worry? Soon we will find you a home. Wandering between the ruins of an extinguished empire is no life for a child.''\n\nThis was the nature of the universe. Brief moments unfolded into the endless cycles of existence. The heady philosophy weighed upon him, but it was more than just another stone in his endless tally of self-imposed guilt. In truth, the boy would inevitably be changed if he was allowed to follow. Remorse darkened Nasus' brow like a thunderhead. Their companionship sated something deep within the ancient hero.\n\n''&quot;We can reach Astrologer's Tower before dawn. But we'll have to climb&quot;'', said the boy.\n\nThe tower was close. Nasus pulled himself up the cliff face hand over hand, the climb memorized to such perfection that he took great liberties with each handhold, tempting death. The boy clambered up by his side, his agile form utilizing every nook and cranny offered by the blemished rock.\n\n''What would happen to this innocent if I gave in to death?'' The thought troubled Nasus.\n\nWisps of fog rolled through the crags of the upper cliffs, each threading the narrow rocks like tiny mountain paths. The boy scurried over the top first. Nasus followed.\n\nIn the distance, metal clanged against stone, and voices could be heard through the haze - they spoke in a familiar dialect. Nasus was shaken from his reverie.\n\n''The well at Astrologer's Tower occasionally attracted nomads, but never this close to the equinox.'' The boy stood perfectly still, his fear palpable.\n\n''&quot;Where are the fires?&quot;'' asked the boy.\n\nA horse's whinny pierced the night.\n\n''&quot;Who goes there?&quot;'' asked the boy. The words rolled through the darkness.\n\nA lantern sparked to life, illuminating a band of riders. ''Mercenaries. Raiders.''\n\nThe jackal's eyes snapped wide.\n\nHe saw seven of them. Their curved blades remained sheathed, but the look in their eyes spoke of martial training and guile.\n\n''&quot;Where is the caretaker?&quot;'' asked Nasus.\n\n''&quot;He and his wife are asleep. The cool evening prompted them to retire early&quot;'', replied one of the riders.\n\n''&quot;Old jackal, my name is Malouf&quot;'', said another rider. ''&quot;We have been sent by the Emperor.&quot;''\n\nNasus stepped forward, betraying the briefest hint of anger.\n\n''&quot;Does he seek acknowledgement? Then let me give it. There is no emperor in this fallen age&quot;'', said Nasus.\n\nThe boy stepped forward defiantly. The dark messengers backed away from the lantern. Long shadows obscured defensive stances.\n\n''&quot;Deliver your message and leave&quot;'', said the child.\n\nMalouf dismounted and stepped forward. He reached a calloused hand into the folds of his shirt and produced a dark amulet bound to a thick, black chain. The geometry of the metal sparked recollections of magic and destruction in Nasus' mind.\n\n''&quot;Emperor {{ci|Xerath}} sends offerings. We are to be your servants. He welcomes you to his new capital at Nerimazeth.&quot;''\n\nThe mercenary's words fell on Nasus like a hammer on glass.\n\nThe boy promptly knelt and snatched up a weighty rock.\n\n''&quot;Die!&quot;'' cried the boy.\n\n''&quot;Take him!&quot;'' said Malouf.\n\nWith a heave, the boy hurled the rock through the air, its perfect arc threatening to shatter mercenary bone on impact.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Renekton}}, no!&quot;'' roared Nasus.\n\nThe riders abandoned their half-hearted deception. Nasus knew then that the caretaker and his wife were dead. Xerath's greeting would come in the form of cold steel. Truth began to eclipse illusion.\n\nNasus reached for the boy. The child tore into shadows of memory that dissipated across the starlit ground.\n\n''&quot;Goodbye, brother&quot;'', whispered Nasus.\n\nXerath's emissaries fanned out, their horses bucking and snorting. The Ascended was flanked on three sides. Malouf did not hesitate, drawing his blade and piercing Nasus' side with it. Pain rippled through the ancient curator's body. The rider attempted to withdraw his weapon, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. A clawed hand gripped the blade, keeping it agonizingly buried within Ascended flesh.\n\n''&quot;You should have left me to my ghosts&quot;'', said Nasus.\n\nNasus tore Malouf's sword from his hand, shattering fingers and tearing ligaments.\n\nThe demigod pounced on his attacker. Malouf's body cracked under the jackal's enormous weight.\n\nNasus leapt to the next rider, pulling him from his saddle; two strikes ruptured organs and stole the wind from his lungs. His broken form spun off into the sand, a ruined mass of agony. His horse reared and fled into the desert.\n\n''&quot;He's mad!&quot;'' said one of the riders.\n\n''&quot;Not any longer&quot;'', said Nasus, approaching the mercenary leader.\n\nA strange fragrance filled the air. Dead flowers spinning on lavender colored threads followed in his wake. Malouf twisted on the ground, the broken fingers of his right hand {{ai|Wither|Nasus|withered}}, skin sagging like wet parchment. The barrel of his chest caved in on itself like a rotting spine fruit.\n\nWhite-knuckled panic overtook the remaining mercenaries. They struggled to keep their mounts under control, if only to retreat. Malouf's body lay abandoned in the sand.\n\nNasus turned east toward the ruins of Nerimazeth.\n\n''&quot;Tell your 'emperor' his cycle nears its end.&quot;''\n\n&lt;gallery type = &quot;slideshow&quot; widths = &quot;640&quot; position = &quot;center&quot; crop = &quot;false&quot; hideaddbutton = &quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFall of the Empire 1.jpg\nFall of the Empire 2.jpg\nFall of the Empire 3.jpg\nFall of the Empire 4.jpg\nFall of the Empire 5.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "id": 75}, "TwistedFate": {"key": "TwistedFate", "name": "Twisted Fate", "title": "the Card Master", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Twisted Fate\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Loaded Dice|Twisted Fate}}\n* {{ai|Wild Cards|Twisted Fate}}\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nTwisted Fate Render.png|Current\nTwisted Fate Cutpurse Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = [[Serpentine River]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Card sharp\n* Thief\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Graves, Illaoi\n|rivals       = Evelynn \n|alias        = * The Card Master\n* Twisted Fate\n|real_name    = Tobias Foxtrot\n|related      = &lt;nowiki/&gt;\n*[http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_01#Evelynn:_The_Bachelormaker?

He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n[[File:Bilgewater Burning Tides A1P1.png|thumb|left|150px]]\n\nBorn to the nomadic river-folk of the Serpentine, the boy was taught the magic of the cards at an early age and soon learned what it was to be hated. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange ways, the boy's people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders claimed this was the way of the world, but their refusal to fight back against this prejudice always rankled the young boy's sensibilities.\n\nWhen men who'd lost their fortunes in the gambling tents of the river folk returned in the dead of night to exact vengeance, they came bearing cudgels and emboldened by cheap rotgut. They beat the river folk back to their boats with curses and blows, eventually turning their weapons upon the boy's family. The boy could take no more and fought back, driving the men away with swift blows from their own clubs.\n\nProud of what he had done, the boy was stunned when his people turned their back on him. Retaliation went against the code of the river, and there could be only one punishment. Exile. His whole world falling apart around him, the boy watched helplessly as the barques of his folk sailed away without him, leaving him with nothing, alone for the first time in his life.\n\nThe boy grew to manhood drifting from town to town, trawling the gambling dens of every city he came to, using his preternatural skill at cards to earn coin to survive. That he was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus. Though always careful to let his opponents win at least some hands, he soon learned more ways to fight when many a disgruntled opponent sought to reclaim their lost fortunes.\n\nAcross one table, he met a fellow named Malcolm Graves and, recognizing a kindred soul, joined forces with him. The two spent years cutting a ruinous swathe across Valoran. With every con, swindle, and heist, he sought ever more dangerous means to make the cards bend to his will.\n\nThat search ended badly when a heist went wrong, resulting in Graves being taken alive, though the riverman ran free. The exact circumstances of that night and its dire consequences for both men remain shrouded in mystery, for the gambler never speaks of it. Seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the waters and took another: Twisted Fate.\n\nIn the time since, Twisted Fate has continued to ply his games of chance in the high parlors and low dens of every city he visits, earning countless fortunes along the way \u2013 though none can say what becomes of these winnings (other than his fine clothes) or why he seems driven to amass such wealth. He has been imprisoned with great fanfare on dozens of occasions, but there is no cell in Runeterra that has been able to hold him. Twisted Fate is always gone with morning's light, leaving only a mocking calling card to speak to his being there at all.\n\nIn Bilgewater, Twisted Fate and Graves finally had their day of reckoning. After a highly destructive running battle, and narrowly avoiding death at the hands of {{ci|Gangplank}}, the pair finally put aside their differences, and are now once again working together.\n\nNigh-on impossible to track, Twisted Fate has been said to vanish into thin air every time an enemy believes they have him cornered. A useful skill indeed for a man who has parted thousands of souls from their gold...\n\n''All eyes in Fortune's Glory were on Twisted Fate. He felt the gambling hall's many patrons regarding him with a mixture of envy, vicarious excitement, and spiteful longing for him to lose everything on the turn of the last card. Beyond the avarice common to dens of chance, Twisted Fate felt a singular purpose at work here, a noose being slowly drawn around his neck. The cards were twitching in agitation, warning him of danger. He knew he should fold and get out before whoever was hunting him sprang their trap, but the opportunity to make a pauper of the man across the table was too enticing to forego.''\n\n''He grinned at his opponent, a greedy merchant whose fortune was built on the whipped backs of enslaved miners. The man's robes were expensive: Freljord furs, hand-tooled leather, and Bilgewater sea charms. Every finger boasted a ring of blood gold worth more than most men would see in a lifetime. Aromatic smoke drifted from clay pipes to hang over the fortune in coin, jewelry, and deeds lying between them like a pirate's treasure horde.''\n\n''Twisted Fate nodded toward the merchant.''\n\n''&quot;I do believe it's your call, Master Henmar.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I am aware of the rules, river rat,&quot; said Henmar, as Twisted Fate ran his tattooed fingers in a repeating spiral pattern on the backs of his cards. &quot;And do not think any of your fancy sleight of hand is going to distract me into making an error of judgment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Distract you?&quot; said Twisted Fate, exuding laconic confidence in every gesture. &quot;I declare, I would never stoop to such a low and dishonorable ruse.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;No? Then why is it your eyes keep darting from the table?&quot; said Henmar. &quot;Listen closely, I have negotiated with the best of them, and I know the tell of a desperate man when I see it.&quot;''\n\n''Twisted Fate gave a sly grin, swapping the cards between his hands and theatrically doffing his wide-brimmed hat.''\n\n''&quot;You're sharp, sir. I can see that,&quot; he said, sweeping his gaze across the gathered crowd. The usual collection of hangers-on; men and women hoping that whoever won might be generous to those nearby. The cards trembled as Twisted Fate's eyes fell upon certain individuals and he felt his mouth fill with the rancid flavor of sour milk. He'd long learned to trust that reaction as a sign of imminent bedlam.''\n\n''There. A man with an eye patch and a flame-haired woman. They were almost certainly armed and well aware of his slippery nature. Did he know them? Probably not. Were they working for Henmar, protecting his assets? Unlikely. A man like Henmar would make it obvious who he'd brought. Bounty hunters then. The cards were growing ever more alarmed in Twisted Fate's hands. He slipped them together and placed them flat on the table.''\n\n''&quot;You have a look that tells me you know you have already lost,&quot; said Henmar with the tone of a man who believes everyone to be his inferior.''\n\n''&quot;Then what say we make this a little more interesting, sir?&quot; replied Twisted Fate, spreading the cards in a fan and watching as the hunters eased closer. &quot;Care to double down?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Are you able to cover that much?&quot; asked Henmar suspiciously.''\n\n''&quot;Easily,&quot; said Twisted Fate, locking his gaze with the merchant and lifting a heavy pouch of coins from the voluminous pockets of his long coat. &quot;Can you?&quot;''\n\n''Henmar licked his lips and snapped his fingers. A flunky behind the merchant handed him a matching bag of coins. The patrons of Fortune's Glory gave a collective moan as it was added to the gold heaped in the middle of the table. Wars had been waged for less coin than was at stake here.''\n\n''&quot;You first,&quot; said Henmar.''\n\n''&quot;Always,&quot; agreed Twisted Fate, flipping over his cards as the bounty hunters made their move.''\n\n''The man with the eye patch lunged at him with a capture collar. The woman shouted his name and drew a matching pair of pistols.''\n\n''Twisted Fate kicked the underside of the table, spinning it into the air in a shower of coins, cards, and parchment. The pistols fired with deafening roars, blasting fist-sized holes in the table. The capture collar snapped closed, but when the smoke cleared and the screams stopped, Twisted Fate was nowhere to be found.''\n\n''Henmar rose to his feet, his face twisted in outrage as he searched in vain for his opponent. He looked down at the broken pieces of the table and the color drained from his face.''\n\n''&quot;Where is the money?&quot; he yelled. &quot;Where is my money?&quot;''\n\n''Five cards fluttered face-up to the floor of Fortune's Glory.''\n\n''A winning hand.''\n{{clr}}\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n", "id": 4}, "Chogath": {"key": "Chogath", "name": "Cho'Gath", "title": "the Terror of the Void", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Cho'Gath\n|alias = The Terror of the Void\n|render = Cho'Gath Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = *[[Void]]born &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;([[Cyborg]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution|Battlecast]] Member {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction =\n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]] \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Malzahar \n|friends = Kog'Maw, Kha'Zix, Vel'Koz\n|rivals = \n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast Army]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Woe betides the day when {{ci|Cho'Gath}} grows weary of the League.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere is a place between dimensions, between worlds. To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown. To those that truly know, however, it is called [[the Void]]. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things - horrors not meant for minds of men. Cho'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name. Its fellows have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into [[Runeterra]], where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world. They are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have been removed from history altogether. It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity.\n\nIf such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will return. Even now, something dark stirs in [[Icathia]], perverting the summoning rituals of [[the League]] to allow the presence of Cho'Gath. It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear. Cho'Gath even appears to {{ai|Feast|Cho'Gath|feed}} on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself. Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a monster could be contained.

When tapping into the spirits' bestial natures, Udyr can harness their unique strengths: the tiger grants him speed and ferocity, the turtle resilience, the bear might, and the phoenix its eternal flame. With their combined power, Udyr can turn back all those who would attempt to harm the natural order.\n\nIn the [[Freljord]], there is a unique caste that lives outside the society of those savage lands. They are the custodians of the natural world: the Spirit Walkers. Once a generation, a child is born under a blood red moon, a child said to live between the two worlds of spirit and man. This child is brought to the Spirit Walker to continue the shamanic line. Udyr was such a child, and knew the howl of the tundra wolves even before he learned the language of his ancestors. Through the Spirit Walker, Udyr would one day learn the meaning of the spirits\u0092 calls and tend to the balance of nature. The Spirit Walker often told Udyr he would be tested more than those who had come before him, for the spirits of the Freljord were growing ever more restless, though the reason remained clouded.\n\nThe answer arrived in the dead of winter, as Udyr and the Spirit Walker were descended upon by a fearsome figure known only through frightened whispers: the Ice Witch. Knowing the boy would fall easy prey to her vile magic, the Spirit Walker shielded the child from her assault at the cost of his own life. Wracked by grief, Udyr howled with fury, and he felt the Freljord itself howl with him. In that moment, the child embraced the spirits'\u0092 primal nature and became a beast himself. Coursing with their untamed power, Udyr'\u0092s angry roar shook the mountaintops and brought down a torrential avalanche. Once Udyr had finally clawed his way out of the frost, the {{ci|Lissandra|Ice Witch}} was nowhere to be found.\n\nFor years, the tribes of the north learned to avoid the wildman and his domain. Then one day, Udyr caught the scent of a fearless trespasser. Determined to chase the intruder from his territory, he attacked, only to be deflected with ease. The wildman launched himself at the stranger again and again, only to be effortlessly cast aside each time. Exhausted and defeated, Udyr felt his animosity ebb and croaked a clumsy \u0093&quot;who&quot;\u0094 to the stranger. {{ci|Lee Sin}} had come seeking the Spirit Walker\u0092's guidance and instead found a man who had also lost his way. The monk promised he would right Udyr\u0092's path and guided him to a monastery said to be protected by four eternal spirits of great power and wisdom. There, Udyr would find harmony.\n\nLee Sin brought Udyr to a land that was a stark contrast to his birthplace. Survival was not the only law that governed the lives of Ionians or creatures of the land. For the first time, Udyr felt at peace with the spirits surrounding him and found comfort in human companionship. His time among the monks taught him to temper his instincts, while his meditations with the ancient temple spirits taught him wisdom. Through them both, Udyr learned to truly embrace his life as the next Spirit Walker.\n\nUdyr owed much to the Ionians. It was a debt he was never asked to honor, but one he would ultimately repay many times over. When the armies of [[Noxus]] invaded, Udyr did not stand idle as the brutal soldiers oppressed the peaceful Ionians - he had not forgotten how to bare his teeth. Udyr leapt at their armies with all the ferocity of a cornered beast and gave the invaders good reason to fear the wilderness. From the trees, his claws tore the Noxians down in scores; on the river banks, he threw them back with the falling tides, and in the fields, he consumed them with searing wildfire. Only when the Noxians fled with their tails between their legs did Udyr quell his rage.\n\nPeace returned to Ionia, but still Udyr felt something stirring him from his rest. The spirits of the Freljord called out to him, warning of an unnatural evil emerging from the ice. Udyr understood the true threat that the Ice Witch posed to his homeland: she was the herald of a greater darkness that would soon envelop the land. Armed with the potent spirits of the temple, Udyr returned to the Freljord, seeking to defend the natural world from all who would threaten its balance.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Through us, nature's will is done.&quot;|'''Udyr'''}}\n\n", "id": 77}, "Morgana": {"key": "Morgana", "name": "Morgana", "title": "Fallen Angel", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Morgana\n|alias = Fallen Angel\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nMorgana Render.png|Present\nMorgana Exiled Render.png|Pre-Fall\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Angel &lt;small&gt;(Fallen)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown\n|residence = [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = &lt;small&gt;(Sinful Succulence Owner {{w|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|enemies = Kayle\n|related = [http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3240624 A Cartful of Carnage]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;There is no rest while {{ci|Kayle}}'s brand of tyranny still exists.&quot;'' - {{ci|Morgana}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere is a world far away populated by graceful and beautiful winged beings gifted with immortality, where an ancient conflict still rages. Like so many conflicts, this war split families.\n\nOne side proclaimed themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world under their law and strong central governance. Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view, who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety.\n\nMorgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was branded {{csl|Morgana|Exiled|'fallen'}}. Morgana was not innocent, having plumbed forgotten ways to gather forbidden might to become a powerful mistress of the black arts.\n\nThis goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general of the opposition's army - her sister, Kayle. While the two were in fact birth-sisters, Kayle struck the first blow by disowning any filial connection when Morgana refused to join her cause.\n\nEventually, Morgana grew in power enough to not only reach, but challenge Kayle.

With the advent of Kayle into the League, Morgana now willingly fights in the League of Legends for the privilege of being able to destroy her sister again, and again, and again.\n\nShe lies in wait for the day the bonds of the Institute of War no longer hold her, and on that day she plans to destroy Kayle once and for all and return home a hero.\n\n", "id": 25}, "Leona": {"key": "Leona", "name": "Leona", "title": "the Radiant Dawn", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Leona\n|alias = \n* The Radiant Dawn\n* Celestial Aspect of the Sun\n* Commander Leona\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona}}\n* {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona}}\n* {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona|(H-Impact CTL Cylinder}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona|(Mounted 9ND08 Energy Shield}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nLeona Render.png|Sun Aspect\nLeona IronSolari Render.png|Iron Solari\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Rakkor Tribe, [[Mount Targon]]\n|residence = Solari Temple, [[Mount Targon]]\n|occupation = \n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(Sun)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiate {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon_Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]]\n* {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|The Solari}}\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Diana, Pantheon\n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/leona.html Radiant Dawn]\n* [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;If you would shine like a sun, first you must burn like one.&quot;'' - {{ci|Leona}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nImbued with the fire of the sun, Leona is a warrior templar of the {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|Solari}} who defends [[Mount Targon]] with her {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona}} and {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona}}. Her skin shimmers with starfire while her eyes burn with the power of the celestial Aspect within her. Armored in gold and bearing a terrible burden of ancient knowledge, Leona brings enlightenment to some, death to others.\n\n==Lore==\nTo live in the lands surrounding the towering peak of Mount Targon is to embrace a life of hardship. That many willingly do so is testament to the power of the human spirit to endure anything in search of meaning and higher purpose. As harsh as the rugged foothills of the mountain's base are, it is nothing compared to the hardships borne by those who dwell on the mountain itself.\n\nLiving high on Targon is fraught with danger. When the glittering mist wreathing the summit descends, it does not come alone. All manner of otherworldly things are left behind when it withdraws; radiant creatures that kill at random and muttering voices that whisper unspeakable secrets to drive mortals mad.\n\nEking a living from mountain plants and their precious herds, the Rakkor tribe dwells at the very limits of human endurance; honing their warrior skills to fight the war at the end of the world. Rakkor means Tribe of the Last Sun, and its people believe that many worlds have existed before this one, each of which has been destroyed by a great catastrophe. Its seers teach that when this sun is destroyed there will be no more, so its warriors must be ready to fight those who seek to extinguish its light.\n \nTo the Rakkor, battle is an act of devotion, an offering to keep the sun's light shining. All members of the tribe are expected to fight and kill without mercy or hesitation, and Leona was no exception. She learned to fight as soon as she could walk, mastering sword and shield with ease. She was fascinated by the mists wreathing the summit and often wondered what might lie beyond them. That fascination did not stop her from fighting the ferocious beasts, inhuman entities and pallid, eyeless strangers that came down the mountain.\n\nShe fought and killed them as she had been taught until one day when young Leona encountered a golden-skinned boy with horns and bat-like wings wandering on the mountainside. He did not speak her language, but it was clear he was lost and frightened. His skin shimmered with soft light, and though everything she had been taught since birth told her to attack, Leona could not bring herself to murder someone so obviously helpless. Instead, she led the boy to a pathway leading to the summit, watching as he walked into a ray of sunlight and vanished.\n\nWhen she returned to the Rakkor, she found herself accused of failing in her duty to the sun. A boy named {{ci|Pantheon|Atreus}} had seen her leading a creature of the mountain to safety instead of killing it. Atreus had told his father what Leona had done and he in turn denounced her as a heretic for going against the beliefs of her people. Leona did not dispute this, and the laws of the Rakkor allowed only one sentence for such a transgression - trial by combat. Leona would face Atreus in the fighting pits beneath the noonday sun, and by its light would judgment be rendered. Leona and Atreus were evenly matched; her warrior skills were formidable, but Atreus had ever been single-minded in his pursuit of martial excellence. Leona took up her sword and shield, Atreus his long spear, and none who gathered around the pit could predict the battle's outcome.\n\nLeona and Atreus fought beneath the blazing sun, and though both bled freely from dozens of wounds, neither could land a deathblow. As the sun dipped toward the horizon, an elder of the Solari marched into the Rakkor camp with three gold-armored warriors and called a halt to the duel. The Solari were adherents of a martial faith built around sun worship, whose unforgiving tenets dictated life around and upon Mount Targon. The elder had been led to the Rakkor by dreams and an ancient Solari prophecy that spoke of a warrior whose fire burned brighter than the sun, a daughter of Targon who would bring unity to the celestial realm. The elder believed Leona was that daughter and upon learning the nature of her transgression, his belief was only strengthened.\n\nThe tribal seers warned against interfering in the duel, but the elder was adamant; Leona must come with him and become one of the Solari, to be fully instructed in their beliefs. The Rakkor were fiercely independent, but even they paid heed to the holy decrees of the Solari. The warriors lifted Leona from the pit and bore her wounded body from the Rakkor toward her new life.\n \nThe Solari temple was a towering citadel on the eastern slopes of Mount Targon, a glittering spire of gold-veined marble and polished granite. Here, Leona learned the ways of the sacred order \u2013 how they worshipped the sun as the source of all life and rejected all other forms of light as false. Its strictures were absolute and unyielding, but fueled by her belief in the elder's prophecy, Leona excelled in this disciplined environment, devouring her new faith's teachings as a parched man in a desert seizes upon fresh water. Leona trained every day with the warrior order of the Solari, the Ra-Horak - a Rakkor title which means Followers of the Horizon - honing her already fearsome skills with a blade into something sublime. In time, Leona rose to command the Ra-Horak, becoming known around Mount Targon as a just, devoted and, some might say, zealous servant of the Sun.\n \nHer path changed forever when she was called to escort a young member of the Solari to the heart of the temple. The girl's hair was purest white and a shimmering rune glowed upon her forehead. Her name was {{ci|Diana}}, a troublemaker well known to Leona from the exasperated woes of the temple elders. Diana had gone missing months before, but now returned, clad in a suit of pale armor that glinted with strange silver light. Diana claimed to bring great news, revelations that would shake the Solari to its foundations, but which she would only reveal to the temple elders.\n \nLeona brought Diana in under armed guard, for her warrior instinct sensed something awry in the girl's demeanor. Presented to the elders, Diana spoke of the {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|Lunari}}, an ancient and proscribed faith that venerated the moon, and how all the truths the Solari clung to were incomplete. She described a realm beyond the mountaintop, a place where the sun and moon were not enemies, where new truths could show them fresh ways to look at the world. Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke, and when the elders rejected her words and named her a blasphemer, Leona knew it would be her blade that ended the heretic's life.\n\nLeona saw Diana's incredulous fury at the elders' denial, but before she could react, the white-haired girl {{ai|Lunar Rush|Diana|hurled herself forward}}. {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|Blinding light}} exploded from Diana's outstretched hands, and {{ai|Pale Cascade|Diana|orbs of silver fire}} burned the elders to dust in the blink of an eye. White flames surged in a hurricane of cold lightning and blasted Leona from the chamber. When she regained consciousness, she found Diana gone and the Solari leaderless. As its remaining members struggled to come to terms with this attack on their most sacred space, Leona knew there was only one path open to her. She would hunt down and destroy the heretic Diana for the murder of the Solari elders.\n\nDiana's trail was easy to find. The heretic's footsteps were like shimmering mercury to Leona's eyes, leading ever higher up the slopes of Mount Targon. Leona did not falter, climbing through a landscape that seemed strange and unfamiliar, as though she followed paths that had never existed until this moment. The sun and moon passed overhead in a blur, as if many days and nights passed with her every breath. She neither stopped to eat nor drink, letting fury sustain her beyond what should have been humanly possible.\n\nEventually Leona reached the top of the mountain, breathless, exhausted, starved and stripped of all thought save punishing Diana. There, sitting on a rock at the top of the mountain was the same golden-skinned boy whose life she had spared as a child. Behind him, the sky burned with blazing light, a borealis of impossible colors and the suggestion of a majestic city of gold and silver. In its fluted towers and glittering minarets, Leona saw how the Solari temple echoed its magnificence and fell to her knees in rapture.\n\nThe golden-skinned boy spoke to her in the old Rakkor tongue, telling her he had been waiting for her to follow him since that day, and that he hoped she wasn't too late. He held out his hand and offered to show her miracles and to know the minds of gods.\n\nLeona had never turned from anything in her life. She took the boy's hand as he smiled and led her into the light. A column of searing illumination stabbed down from the heavens and engulfed Leona. She felt an awesome presence filling her limbs with terrifying power and forgotten knowledge from the earliest epochs of the world. Her armor and weapons burned to ash in the cosmic fire and were in turn reborn as ornate warplate, {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona|a shield of sunlight}} wrought in gold and {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona|a sword of chained dawnlight}}.\n\nThe warrior who came down the mountain looked the same as the one who had climbed it, but inside Leona was much changed. She still had her memories and thoughts, was still master of her own flesh, but a sliver of something vast and inhuman had chosen her to be its mortal vessel. It gifted her with incredible powers and awful knowledge that haunted her eyes and weighed heavily upon her soul; knowledge she could only ever share with one person.\n\nNow, more than ever, Leona knew she had to find Diana.\n\n;The Light Bringer\nThe raiders attacked before dawn; fifty wolf-lean men in iron hauberks mantled with strange furs and bearing ash-dulled axes. Their steps were swift as they entered the settlement at the foot of the mountain. These were men who had fought as brothers for years, who lived in the heartbeat between life and death. A warrior in battered scale armor and bearing a heavy-bladed greatsword over his shoulder led them. Beneath his dragon-helm, his face was bearded and raw, burned by a lifetime of war-making under a harsher sun than this.\n\nThe previous settlements had been easily overcome; little challenge for men weaned on battle. The spoils were few and far between, but in this strange land, a man took what he could get. \n\n''This one would be no different.''\n\nSudden light flared ahead, sunlight gleaming brightly. \n\n''Impossible. Dawn was an hour or more away.''\n\nThe leader raised a callused hand as he saw a lone figure standing athwart the settlement's street. He grinned as he saw it was a woman. ''Finally, something worth plundering.'' Light inflamed her, and the grin fell from his face as he stepped closer and saw she was clad in ornate warplate. Auburn hair spilled from a golden circlet and sunlight glinted from {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona|her heavy shield}} and {{ai|Zenith Blade|Leona|long-bladed sword.}}\n\nMore warriors emerged from the street, taking their place to either side of the woman, each gold-armored and bearing a long spear.\n\n''&quot;These lands are under my protection&quot;'', she said.\n\n{{ci|Leona}} lifted her sword as the twelve warriors of the Ra-Horak formed a wedge with her at their center. Six to either side, they swung their shields and hammered them down as one. Leona made a quarter turn and locked her own shield into place at the apex. Her sword slid into the thrust groove beneath the shield's bladed halo.\n\nShe flexed her fingers on the leather-wound grip of her sword, feeling the surge-tide of power within her. A coiled fire that ached to be released. Leona held it within her, letting it ease into her flesh. Embers flecked her eyes and her heart pounded in her chest. The being she had joined with atop the mountain longed to burn these men with its cleansing fire.\n\n''Dragon-helm is the key. Kill him and the rest will falter.''\n\nPart of Leona wanted to give the power in her free reign; wanted to scorch these men to smoldering bone and ash. Their attacks had killed scores of people who called the lands around [[Mount Targon]] home. They had defiled the sacred places of the {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|Solari}}, toppling sacred sun stones and polluting the mountain springs with their excretions.\n\nDragon-helm laughed and swung his greatsword from his shoulders as his men moved away from him. To fight with such a huge weapon and keep it in constant motion needed space. He yelled something in a guttural tongue that sounded more like animal barks than anything human, and his warriors gave an answering roar.\n\nLeona let out a hot breath as the raiders charged, their braided beards flecked with frothed spittle as they pounded toward the Ra-Horak. Leona let the fire into her blood, feeling the ancient creature merge its essence with hers more completely, becoming one with her senses and gifting her with perceptions not of this world.\n\nTime slowed for Leona. She saw the pulsing glow of each enemy's heart and heard the thunderous drum-beat of their blood. To her, their bodies were hazed with the red fires of battle-lust. Dragon-helm leapt forward, his sword hammering Leona's shield like a stone titan's fist. The impact was ferocious, buckling the metal and driving her back a full yard. The Ra-Horak stepped back with her, keeping the shieldwall unbroken. Leona's shield blazed with light and Dragon-helm's mantle of fur smoldered in its furnace heat. His eyes widened in surprise as he hauled his enormous sword back for another strike.\n\n''&quot;Brace and thrust!&quot;'' she yelled as the rest of the raiders hit their line. Golden spears thrust at the instant of impact and the first rank of attackers fell with their bellies pierced by mountain-forged steel. They were trampled underfoot as the warriors behind them pressed the attack.\n\nThe shieldwall buckled, but held. Axes smashed down, sinews swelled and throats grunted with the effort of attack. Leona thrust her sword through the neck of a raider with a scar bisecting his face from crown to jaw. He screamed and fell back, his throat filling with blood. Her shield slammed into the face of the man next to him, caving in his skull.\n\nThe Ra-Horak's line bent back as Dragon-helm's sword slammed down again, this time splintering the shield of the warrior next to her. The man dropped, cloven from neck to pelvis.\n\nLeona didn't give Dragon-helm the chance for a third strike.\n\nShe thrust her golden sword toward him and a searing echo of its image blazed from the rune-cut blade. White-hot fire engulfed Dragon-helm, his furs and hair instantly igniting and his armor fusing to his flesh like a brand. He shrieked in hideous pain, and Leona felt the cosmic power inside her revel in the man's agony. He staggered backward, somehow still alive and screaming as her fire melted the flesh from his bones. His men faltered in their assault as he fell to his knees as a blazing pyre.\n\n''&quot;Into them!&quot;'' shouted Leona, and the Ra-Horak surged forward. Powerful arms stabbed spear blades with brutal efficiency. Thrust, twist, withdraw. Over and over again like the relentless arms of a threshing machine. The raiders turned and fled from the Ra-Horak's blood-wetted blades, horrified at their war-leader's doom. Now they sought only to escape.\n\nHow and why these raiders had come to Targon was a mystery, for they had clearly not come to bear witness on the mountain nor make an ascent. They were warriors, not pilgrims, and left alive they would only regroup to kill again.\n\nLeona could not allow that and thrust her sword into the earth. She reached deep inside herself, drawing on the awesome power from beyond the mountain. The sun emerged from behind its highest peaks as Leona thrust her hand to the light.\n \nShe dropped to one knee and slammed her fist on the ground. \n\nAnd {{ai|Solar Flare|Leona|sunfire}} rained from the sky.\n\n", "id": 89}, "Caitlyn": {"key": "Caitlyn", "name": "Caitlyn", "title": "the Sheriff of Piltover", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Caitlyn\n|alias =\n* The Sheriff of Piltover\n* Cupcake\n* Hat Lady\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Piltover Peacemaker|Caitlyn|Peacemaker}}\n* {{ai|Yordle Snap Trap|Caitlyn}}\n* {{ai|90 Caliber Net|Caitlyn}}\n|render = Caitlyn Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = [[Piltover]] Police Force Sheriff\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Jayce, Ezreal, Vi\n|rivals = Jinx, Ekko\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Go ahead, run.

This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover.\n\nBorn the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, as she was single-handedly defeating crime in Piltover and had developed into a ravishing beauty as well. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by [[Demacia]] to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.\n\nThe bandit, who always left a card with an ornate {{sbc|'C'}} at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across [[Valoran]].

Orphaned at a young age, Darius had to fight to keep himself and {{ci|Draven|his younger brother}} alive. By the time he joined the military, he had already developed the strength and discipline of a veteran soldier.\n\nThe first true test of Darius' resolve occurred in a crucial battle against [[Demacia]], where the Noxian forces were exhausted and outnumbered. Darius' captain called for his troops to retreat, but Darius refused to accept such an act of cowardice. Breaking formation, Darius strode towards the captain and {{ai|Noxian Guillotine|Darius|decapitated him}} with one sweep of his gigantic axe. Both terrified and inspired, the soldiers followed Darius into battle and fought with incredible strength and fervor. After a long and grueling battle, they ultimately emerged victorious. Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops in a devastating campaign against Demacia.\n\nAfter proving his power on the battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation's strength. Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to reshape the Noxian leadership.

This belief was put to the test when a rash of sleep-related incidents started afflicting [[summoner]]s of the [[the League of Legends|League]]. Some would wake up screaming, terrified and beyond consolation. Some could not fall asleep, slowly going mad as the nights ticked by. Some simply never woke up. Physicians were baffled until a [[Field of Justice|Field]] Architect happened to pass out next to a [[nexus]] on the [[Twisted Treeline]]. Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after, magical energy arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.\n\nNocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered everything he could find before summoners were able to magically confine him. After a period of intense study, League experts divined that Nocturne hunted summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was useless. This seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded justice, but League officials were concerned that death might only return Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus fragment, trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed summoners to call upon Nocturne in League matches, bending his will to the summoners he hates and creating his own personal nightmare. League scholars don\u2019t know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether there are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected the summoners' subconscious minds, luring Nocturne to them in their sleep. Perhaps the most disturbing theory is that Nocturne is a person\u2019s nightmare come to life. If this is true, they wonder, who is the dreamer?\n\n{{quote|\u201cThe darkness is closing in... it\u2019s pitch black now... but I can still see him...\u201d|'''Kevin Ma, patient #4236'''}}\n\n== Quotes ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nClassic=\n;Upon selection\n* {{sm2|Nocturne Select.ogg|''&quot;Embrace the darkness.&quot;''}}\n\n;Attacking\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack1.ogg|''&quot;Cut them from this world!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack2.ogg|''&quot;Suffer eternally!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack3.ogg|''&quot;Their twilight approaches.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack4.ogg|''&quot;The light is fading.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack5.ogg|''&quot;Drip drop, the sound of blood.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.attack6.ogg|''&quot;Help is not coming...&quot;''}}\n\n;Movement\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move1.ogg|''&quot;I sense fear.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move2.ogg|''&quot;Do I scare you, summoner?&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move3.ogg|''&quot;Are you getting tired yet?&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move4.ogg|''&quot;This place disgusts me.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move5.ogg|''&quot;People are flames to be blotted out.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move6.ogg|''&quot;Afraid of the dark?&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move7.ogg|''&quot;Cross over.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move8.ogg|''&quot;Swim in terror!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.move9.ogg|''&quot;Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?&quot;''}}\n\n;Taunt\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.taunt.ogg|''&quot;Bring me more flesh bags to slice up!&quot;''}}\n\n;Joke\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.joke.ogg|''&quot;Weather forecast for tonight: dark, with a chance of pain!&quot;''}}\n\n;Laugh\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.laugh1.ogg|''Nocturne laughs.''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.laugh2.ogg|''Nocturne laughs.''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.laugh3.ogg|''Nocturne laughs.''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.laugh4.ogg|''Nocturne laughs.''}}\n\n;Upon using {{ai|Paranoia|Nocturne}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.ult1.ogg|''&quot;All alone...&quot; ''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.ult2.ogg|''&quot;Darkness...&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.ult3.ogg|''&quot;Darkness...&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Nocturne.ult4.ogg|''Nocturne laughs.''}}\n|-|\nEternum=\n;Attacking\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack1.ogg|''&quot;Fate cannot be averted.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack2.ogg|''&quot;So it must be.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack3.ogg|''&quot;No further meddling&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack4.ogg|''&quot;Despair in our presence!&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack5.ogg|''&quot;Their impudence ends.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack6.ogg|''&quot;No recourse for survival.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack7.ogg|''&quot;They are right to fear.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack8.ogg|''&quot;Deprive them of life.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack9.ogg|''&quot;They pose unacceptable risk.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.attack10.ogg|''&quot;Their existence is a mistake.&quot;''}}\n\n;Movement\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move1.ogg|''&quot;Long have we waited.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move2.ogg|''&quot;The end of days draws near.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move3.ogg|''&quot;Fulfill destiny.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move4.ogg|''&quot;A blight takes this land.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move5.ogg|''&quot;What was, is, and will forever be.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move6.ogg|''&quot;A trail manifests.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move7.ogg|''&quot;We transcend time.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|EternumNocturne.move8.ogg|''&quot;The first are we.

Surveying the grounds for signs of degradation is no small task; taking readings every five feet is essential in order to detect even the slightest disturbances in the intricate energy fields. An overlooked spike in the surrounding forces could set off a chain reaction of destruction due to the rampant use of magic on the Fields of Justice. In his own little way, he liked to think that he was saving Runeterra one checkpoint at a time.\n\nHis work complete, the architect makes his way back to the summoning platform, where he passes a nexus that should have been dormant. An unbidden spark inside the nexus catches his eye. He turns to investigate only to be struck by a wild burst of energy arcing out of the nexus. The architect collapses to the floor in a heap, sprawling on the unforgiving cobblestone.\n\nHis body shrivels as a noxious trail of thick smoke pours out of his open mouth. It is shivering with life and pulsing with horrors.\n\nIt is born of nightmares.\n\n;REFLECTION\n\nNocturne had drifted through the minds of humans for endless expanses of time. He beheld the faces they yearned for, absorbed the desires that coursed through their veins, and inhabited the fantasies that set their hearts ablaze. He lingered within the despicably human illusions they conjured in the narrow expanse that was their puny brains.\n\nFrom all of them, he consumed the magic that rippled through their souls.\n\nNocturne had only a moment to examine his new found physical form before a circle of robed summoners appeared around him. He knew who they were before they even revealed themselves. These were the overlords whose faces consumed each mind of every summoner whose dreams he haunted. They were the voices that drenched lesser kinds with promises of great power, and they were the hands that directed the ebb and flow of the entire world. Nocturne knew what these humans wanted, but they would not get him.\n\nHis shadowed form ghosted silently toward one of the humans, reaching out with the ethereal tendrils of his consciousness. The cloaked human spasmed as his hands rose to tear at his own head. A bloodcurdling scream ripped through the air, then choked off into silence as the human's mind collapsed into itself.\n\nThe other humans barely had a chance to react before Nocturne was on them. He reached out with his limbs as twin blades extended forth from his arms to rend human flesh from bone. The shadow darted low and slashed upwards with his blades, impaling an unfortunate summoner through the entire length of his body.\n\nNocturne felt a group of humans rush up from behind; for a second, his form pulsed. Darkness smothered the entire field, an oppressive blackness that breathed and sighed. Victims eternally trapped in the phantasm murmured in the summoners' ears, promising eternal torment and pleading for release. Disembodied hands clawed at the living, desperate to rip any semblance of existence away for their own keeping.\n\nThe remaining summoners lashed out, flailing against the ghastly fingers that only disappeared long enough to reappear again in greater numbers. Spell incantations decayed on their lips as the magical energies refused to heed their call. The darkness began to suffocate the humans, and they clawed at their eyes in a wild attempt to regain their sight. Devoured by terror, they didn't even sense Nocturne's approach, nor did they feel the blades that cleaved through their soft bodies and condemned their souls to an eternity in the darkness.\n\nOne summoner had stood apart from the others. He was decorated with gold chains draped over purple robes. Unaffected by the blindness and horrors, he had chosen to observe impassively as the carnage unfurled. No expression flickered over his face as the pooled blood stained the hem of his robes, nor did his visage change when the dismembered head of his former comrade bumped up against his leg.\n\nThe summoner spoke. &quot;Impressive. I see that the eons you've spent leeching off our minds have managed to serve some purpose.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know who you are.&quot; Nocturne returned.\n\n&quot;I'm flattered.&quot; The summoner sneered. &quot;Then you should also know that it is time you repay us for the horrors you have wrought upon our kind.&quot;\n\n&quot;And how do you plan to do that, human?&quot; A monstrous howl echoed from the shadows, something akin to what those humans called a laugh.\n\n&quot;You are now in the world of our control. And you shall be in our service.&quot;\n\n&quot;You call this pitiful existence 'payment'?&quot; A flick of Nocturne's hideous blade sent a pile of steaming entrails splattering across the ground. He readied the jagged edge for this last foolish one. &quot;You may have conjured me into your world somehow, but all you will receive is destruction.&quot;\n\nWith a roar, Nocturne heaved himself at the summoner. His blood-soaked blade came within a razor's width of carving that aggravating smirk off the human's face. Metal circled around his wrists, clanging shut, and sent him flying backwards into a heap of metal chains.\n\n&quot;No. This is your reparation.&quot; The summoner's lips parted, wet with anticipation. &quot;Welcome to the League.&quot;\n\nThe summoners whose bodies lay in a pile around him raised their heads. Their arms shot out and clamped onto Nocturne with an iron grip. They dragged him downward, forcing his physical existence into submission. Every part of him screamed out against the shackles as he involuntarily bowed to the towering head summoner. Nocturne was now in service to the League, and it was his own eternal nightmare.}}\n\n== Development ==\n''{{ci|Nocturne}} was designed by [[Ezreal (person)|Ezreal]]''.\n&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; position=&quot;center&quot; widths=&quot;640&quot; crop=&quot;false&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nNocturne OriginalSkin old.jpg|1st Classic Nocturne splash art\nNocturne OriginalSkin old2.jpg|2nd Classic Nocturne splash art\nNocturne FrozenTerrorSkin old.jpg|1st Frozen Terror Nocturne splash art\nNocturne RavagerSkin old.jpg|1st Ravager Nocturne splash art\nNocturne concept.png|Nocturne concept art 1\nNocturne SneakPeek.jpg|Nocturne concept art 2\nNocturne Official Artwork.jpg|Nocturne poster (by Riot Artist [http://davidrapozaart.deviantart.com/ David Rapoza])\nNocturne Render old.png|Old Nocturne texture\nNocturne Eternum concept.jpg|Eternum Nocturne concept art (by Riot Artist [[Michael 'IronStylus' Maurino|Michael Maurino]])\nNocturne CursedRevenant concept.jpg|Cursed Revenant Nocturne concept art (by Riot Artist [[Sunny Koda]])\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n=== Champion Sneak Peek ===\n''Have you ever taken in a horror film only to go to bed with your eyes wide open on the lookout for things that go thump in the night?

It perished long ago in a terrible [[Valoran#The Rune Wars|Rune War]], like most of the lands below [[the Great Barrier]]. Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named {{cbi|Zilean}}. Being obsessed with time, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city's Clock Tower. As the havoc of the war neared his home, '''Zilean''' experimented with powerful temporal magic to divine all possible futures, hoping to discover a peaceful solution. But '''Zilean's''' enchantments affected his perception of the passage of time, and he was in a contemplative stasis when Urtistan was set upon by an entire phalanx of dark summoner-knights of unknown affiliation. By the time he realized his error, Urtistan was nothing more than smoldering debris. The [[summoners]] who were responsible for its destruction had wisely left the Clock Tower unharmed, both to avoid drawing '''Zilean's''' attention and to torment him for his oversight.\n\n'''Zilean''' barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous research had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia. This mystical disease granted him immortality, but detached his consciousness from its anchor in the present time. He now mentally drifts through time, from any point he has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold. The most torturous aspect of this curse is that '''Zilean''' sometimes experiences Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins. Only the powerful summoning magic employed by members of [[the League of Legends]] has been able to treat this condition, and '''Zilean''' has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save his people.\n\n{{quote|&quot;There is no greater grief than for a loss that is yet to come.&quot;|'''{{cbi|Zilean}}'''}}\n{{clr}}\n|-|\nExpanded=\n=== The Festival of Flight ===\n\nTensions between Piltover and Zaun renewed as the 16th Festival of Flight race drew near, marking the beginning of the annual Techmaturgical Conference. The city of Zaun had been named victor of the symbolic event for the last four years running, though they showed a great deal of trepidation towards the upcoming match after Piltover publicly unveiled their new state-of-the-art Zeppelin.\n\n[[File:Piltover_Zepeling_race.png|thumb|left|The Tailwind|200px]]\nWhile it's difficult to classify any dirigible as small, the appropriately named \u201cTailwind\u201d aircraft was a record-breaking length of 27 meters. Not only was it the first Zeppelin to meet such small size constraints, but it also pioneered the utilization of Piltoverian Chrono-Technology. The new prototype \u201cChrono-propeller\u201d engine, which received tremendous design contributions from {{ci|Zilean|Zilean, the Chronokeeper}}, was rumored to manipulate time itself to reach speeds that would otherwise be impossible under Valoran\u2019s constantly changing atmospheric conditions. The Zeppelin would be piloted in the race by {{ci|Janna|Janna, the Storm's Fury}}, who was once one of Zaun\u2019s most promising mage talents before defecting from the city-state several years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Journal of Justice: Volume 1, Issue 14#It Takes Time to Win-d|It Takes Time to Win-d]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Piltover Wins the Annual Zeppelin Race ===\nJanna\u2019s record-breaking Zeppelin &quot;Tailwind&quot; defeated the Zaunite flagship &quot;Lead Zeppelin&quot; at the annual Techmaturgical Conference in Piltover. Zaun's &quot;Lead Zeppelin&quot; had maintained a strong lead from the race\u2019s start in Piltover. The Zaunite flagship, a powerhouse of black metal and Zaunite techmaturgy, had claimed victory at the Conference for the past four years. As the two Zeppelins crossed the Bluewind Bay, however, Tailwind\u2019s chrono-propeller engine allowed the craft to navigate through the bay's storms utterly unfettered, securing Piltover\u2019s victory.\n\n=== The Clock Tower ===\nWhile wandering across southern Valoran, {{ci|Vel'Koz}} and his fellow void &quot;companions&quot; stumbled upon the Ruins of Urtistan. Fascinated, Vel'Koz deconstructs one of the ruins and analyzes them, discovering that place once held powerful magics. He ventures within the Clock Tower to discover numerous, highly advanced technology within, the likes of which even he himself has never seen.

His kit was such that no new power could be added safely--his R often full heals, his Q does so much damage that it needs sharp mana-gating to prevent Zilean from winning lane automatically, buffing his passive or W would be a de facto Q buff, and his E already permanently slows or hastes things. By the nature of his spells, and specifically the Q's targetting paradigm, it was impossible for us to responsibly add power to Zilean though he sorely needed it. Having all of his damage come from directly targetted effects leaves insufficient room for play from him or his opponent, and tends to result in a relatively flat outcome.''\n\n''Through careful balancing of cosmic forces, Zilean has unraveled this riddle by pulling a single thread: converting his targetted Time Bomb into a lobbed sticky bomb. Time Bomb is now tossed to its destination, attaches to the first unit to come near it (prioritizing champions), and persists even if it hits the ground. By adding in a way for enemies to play against his Time Bomb, Zilean can safely channel more temporal power. Much more.''\n\n''Attaching two {{ai|Time Bomb|Zilean|Time Bombs}} to the same unit detonates the first early, just like on live--only now that detonation stuns enemies in the radius of the {{ai|Time Bomb|Zilean}}, making it the largest non-ultimate stun in the game. His Time Bombs have more range and cost less mana, though they do slightly less damage. By remaining active on the ground, Zilean can create large zones of control around the map, using them to block passages, scout brushes, or stack two bombs on the same place to instantly stun enemies who attempt to move through while dealing massive AE damage--brutally effective area denial. He can also put a pair of bombs on an allied champion to stun all enemies around them.''\n\n''Time Warp is supercharged, recieving greatly reduced mana cost and cooldown. It has slightly reduced effectiveness at rank 1, and its cast range has been brought in line with most ADC autoattacks to keep it from negating the skill component of Q--he can use his Time Warp to guarantee a stun, but he has to put himself at risk to do it. Time warp also now scales in effectiveness by rank instead of in duration, eventually reaching 99% haste/slow at rank 5. This sharply improves the responsiveness and effectivenss of Time Warp lategame.''\n''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''\n''Next, {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} has been decoupled from his Rewind, going to 120/90/60 from 180/180/180 but no longer being reduced by Rewind. This change is important for his new balancability--previously, we had no way to adjust {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean|Chronoshift's}} cooldown lategame without changing it early game or altering Rewind at large. The change should be neutral-to-positive for Zileans until rank 5 Rewind and max CDR, at which point it's a slight nerf. You still can't killean the Zilean--the idea here is to take {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} out of being twice-a-fight lategame now that it no longer has to be such a gigantic portion of his power budget.''\n\n''Zilean's autoattack timing has long been one of the worst in the game, but with his practice tossing bombs his throwing arm has gotten quite a workout--he should find last-hitting much easier now. He also had the same attack range as Ashe/Varus mainly by virtue of being one of our oldest champions (har har); that kind of power costs too much for how little it helps, so his range has been brought in line with most ADCs (550 from 600).''\n\n''Lastly, power looks good. His particle effects and spell icons have been updated to reflect this. Zilean's got swag.''\n\n== Previous Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|Old lore= \nBETA LORE\n\nRising from the cracked, dried lakebeds of Urizan is a tower, shaped like a huge grandfather clock. Impenetrable and unassailable, there are no doors into it, nor any openings to climb or fly into. There is no water or vegetation within a hundred miles of this structure, only the desiccated remains of what was once a beautiful flourishing lake, now destroyed by the ravages of war and the hands of time. This is the way he wants it, the man who constructed this tower out here in the middle of nowhere. He has no need of supplies. Has no desire for visitors. Inside, {{cbi|Zilean}} tinkers with his clocks. They cover his workshop. Hundreds of them, maybe thousands. Some work; most do not. He is obsessed with time. For he is both blessed and cursed by it. Blessed because he has discovered the way to manipulate time, making it move forward and back at his whims. Cursed because each time he does, he leaves a little piece of himself behind, doomed to see the world how it was, is, and eventually will be\u2014all at the same time. That is why he lives here, in the middle of a drained, dead lake. When he looks out the window he can see it as it was, hundreds of years ago, beautiful and alive. But at some point he must look away, for watching it be destroyed over and over again for all eternity could drive even the most solid mind insane.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n== Previous Abilities ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|\nShow=\n&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nChronoblast.png|Chronoblast\nMind_Twist.png|Mind Twist\nTime_Stop.png|Time Stop\nChrono-_Recall.png|'''Recall''' (Active): Zilean channels temporal energy to refresh an ally\u2019s ability.\nChrono-_Time_Twister.png|'''Time Twister''' (Active): Zilean unleashes an area of effect debuff on enemy units in a single location.

I will make it so again.&quot;'' - {{ci|Azir}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAzir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an [[Ascended]] being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.\n\n==Lore==\nThousands of years ago, the Shuriman empire was a sprawling realm of vassal states conquered by powerful armies led by all but invincible warriors known as the Ascended. Ruled by an ambitious and power hungry emperor, Shurima was the greatest realm of its day; a fertile land blessed by the power of the sun that shone from a great golden disc floating atop the temple at the heart of its capital.\n\nThe youngest and least-favored son of the emperor, Azir was never destined for greatness. With so many siblings ahead of him, he would never be emperor. Most likely he would take up a position in the priesthood or as governor of some backwater province. He was a slender, studious boy who spent more time perusing the texts collected in the Great Library of {{ci|Nasus}} than training to fight under the stern tutelage of the Ascended hero, {{ci|Renekton}}.\n\nAmid the twisting shelves of scrolls, books and tablets, Azir met a young slave boy who visited the library almost every day in search of texts desired by his master. Slaves in Shurima were forbidden to take names, but as the two boys became friends, Azir broke that law and called his new friend {{ci|Xerath}}, which means 'one who shares'. He appointed Xerath - though he was careful never to endanger him by naming him publicly - as his personal slave and the two boys shared their love of history by learning all they could of Shurima's past and its long legacy of Ascended heroes.\n\nWhile traveling with his father, brothers and Renekton on the yearly tour of the empire, the royal caravan stopped at a well-known oasis for the night. Azir and Xerath stole away in the middle of the night to draw the stars and add their own celestial maps to those they had studied in the Great Library. While they drew the patterns of constellations, the royal caravan was attacked by a cabal of assassins sent by the emperor's enemies. One of the assassins found the two boys out in the desert and was poised to cut Azir's throat when Xerath intervened, throwing himself upon the assassin's back. In the ensuing melee, Azir freed his dagger and plunged it into his attacker\u2019s throat.\n\nAzir took up the dead man's sword and rushed back to the oasis, but by the time he returned, the assassins were already defeated. Renekton had protected the emperor and slain the attackers, but Azir's brothers were all dead. Azir told his father of Xerath's courage and asked him to reward the slave boy, but his words fell on deaf ears. In the emperor's eyes, the boy was a slave and beneath his notice, but Azir swore that one day he and Xerath would be brothers.\n\nThe emperor returned to his capital, with the fifteen year old Azir now his heir, and unleashed a merciless campaign of bloodshed against those he believed had sent the assassins. Shurima descended into years of paranoia and murder as the emperor took revenge on any he suspected of treason. Though he was now heir to the throne, Azir's life yet hung by a thread. His father hated him - wishing he had died instead of his brothers - and the queen was still young enough to bear sons.\n\nAzir trained in combat, for the attack at the oasis had revealed how little he knew of the deadly arts. Renekton took up the task of teaching the growing prince, and under his aegis, Azir learned to wield sword and spear, {{ai|Arise!|Azir|to command warriors}}, and to read the ebb and flow of battle. The young heir elevated Xerath, his only trusted confidant, and made him his right-hand man. To better counsel him, Azir tasked Xerath with seeking out knowledge wherever he could find it.\n\nYears passed, but the queen was never able to carry a child to term, every conceived infant perishing before it could be born. So long as the queen remained barren, Azir's life was relatively safe. Some around the court believed a curse was at work and a few even whispered the young heir's name in connection with this \u2013 though Azir claimed innocence and even executed some who dared voice such accusations openly.\n\nEventually, the queen bore a healthy son, but on the night of his birth a terrible storm engulfed Shurima. The queen's chambers were struck again and again by powerful bolts of lightning, and in the subsequent blaze, both the queen and her newborn son were killed. It was said the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life upon hearing the news, but tales soon spread of how he and his guards had been found lying in pieces on the palace floor, their bodies little more than charred skeletons.\n\nAzir was shocked by their deaths, but the empire needed a leader, and with Xerath at his side he took control of Shurima as its emperor. Over the next decade, he expanded Shurima's borders and ruled with a harsh, but just hand. He instituted reforms to better the lives of slaves and privately developed a plan to overturn millennia of tradition and eventually free them all. He kept his plans secret, even from Xerath, and the issue of slavery would prove to be a continual bone of contention between them. The empire had been built on the back of slavery, and many of the great noble houses depended on enforced labor for their vast wealth and power. Such monolithic institutions could not be overturned overnight, and Azir's plans would be undone were they to become common knowledge. Despite Azir's desire to name Xerath his brother, he could not do so until all Shurima's slaves were free.\n\nThrough these years, Xerath protected Azir from his political rivals and guided the expansion of the empire. Azir married and fathered numerous children, some by wedlock, others by ill-advised liaisons with slaves and harem girls. Xerath stoked the emperor's grand vision of an empire greater than any the world had ever known. But to stand as ruler over the entire world, Xerath convinced Azir that he would need to be all but invincible, a god amongst men \u2013 an Ascended being.\n\nAs the kingdom reached the zenith of its power, Azir announced he would undertake the Ascension ritual, that the time was right for him to take his place alongside Nasus and Renekton and their glorious forebears. Many questioned this decision; the Ascension ritual was highly dangerous and intended only for those near the end of their lives, those who had devoted their lives to Shurima and whose service was to be honored with Ascension. It was for the Sun Priests to decree who would be blessed with Ascension, not the hubris of an emperor to bestow it upon himself. Azir would not be dissuaded from his rash course of action, for his arrogance had grown along with his empire, and he ordered them to comply on pain of death.\n\nThe day of the ritual finally came and Azir marched toward the Dais of Ascension, flanked by thousands of his warriors and tens of thousands of his subjects. The brothers Renekton and Nasus were absent, having been dispatched by Xerath to deal with an emergent threat, but still Azir would not turn from what he saw as his great destiny. He climbed to {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|the great golden disc}} atop the temple at the heart of the city and in the moments before the sun priests began the ritual, he turned to Xerath and finally freed him. And not just him, but all slaves...\n\nXerath was stunned into speechlessness, but Azir was not yet done. He embraced Xerath and named him his eternal brother, as he had promised he would all those years ago. Azir turned as the priests began the ritual to bring down the awesome power of the sun. Azir was unaware that Xerath had studied more than just history and philosophy in his quest for knowledge. He had learned the dark arts of sorcery, all the while nursing a desire for freedom that had grown like a cancer into a burning hatred.\n\nAt the height of the ritual, the former slave unleashed his powers and Azir was blasted from his place on the dais. Without the protection of the runic circle, Azir was consumed by the sun's fire as Xerath took his place. The light filled Xerath with power, and he roared as his mortal body began to transform.\n\nBut the magic of the ritual was not intended for Xerath, and such awesomely powerful celestial energies could not be diverted without dire consequence. The power of the Ascension ritual exploded outward, devastating Shurima and laying waste to the city. Its people burned to ash and its towering palaces fell to ruin as the desert sands rose up to swallow the city. The sun disc sank from the sky and what had taken centuries to build was brought to ruin in an instant by one man's ambition and another's misplaced hate. All that remained of Azir's city were sunken ruins and echoes of its people's screams on the night winds.\n\nAzir saw none of this. For him, all was nothingness. His last memories were of pain and fire; he knew nothing of what befell him atop the temple, nor what became of his empire. He remained lost in timeless oblivion until, thousands of years after Shurima's doom, the blood of {{ci|Sivir|his last descendant}} spilled onto the temple ruins and resurrected him. Azir was reborn, but was yet incomplete; his body little more than animate dust given form, held together by the last vestiges of his indomitable will.\n\nGradually resuming his corporeal form, Azir stumbled through the ruins and came across the corpse of a woman with a treacherous knife wound in her back. He did not know her, but saw in her features the distant echo of his bloodline. All thoughts of empires and power were forgotten as he lifted this daughter of Shurima and bore her to what had once been the Oasis of the Dawn. The oasis was empty and dry, but with every step Azir took, clear water began filling the rocky basin. Azir immersed the woman's body in the restorative waters of the oasis and as the blood washed away, only a faint scar remained where the blade had pierced her.\n\nAnd with that act of selflessness, Azir was lifted up in a column of fire as the magic of Shurima renewed him, remaking him as the Ascended being he was meant to become. The sun's immortal radiance poured into him, crafting his magnificent, hawk-armored form and granting him the power to command the very sand itself. Azir lifted his arms and his ruined city shrugged off the dust of centuries spent beneath the desert to rise anew. The {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} lifted into the sky once more, and healing waters flowed between temples heaving themselves back into the light at the emperor's command.\n\nAzir climbed the steps of the newly-risen sun temple, weaving the desert winds to recreate the city's last moments. Ghosts formed of sand relived his city's last moments from long ago, and Azir watched in horror as Xerath's treachery unfolded. He wept as he saw his family murdered, his empire fall and his power stolen. Only now, millennia too late, did he finally understand the depths of hatred harbored by his former friend and ally. With the power and prescience of an Ascended being, Azir sensed Xerath somewhere abroad in the world and summoned {{ai|Arise!|Azir|an army of sand warriors}} to march alongside their reborn emperor. As the sun blazed from {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|the golden disc}} above him, Azir swore a mighty oath.\n\n''I will reclaim my lands and take back what was mine!''\n\n;Arisen\n{{ci|Azir}} walked the gold-paved Emperor's Way. The immense statues of [[Shurima]]'s earliest rulers \u2013 his ancestors \u2013 watched his progress.\n\nThe soft, shadowy light of predawn seeped through his city. The brightest stars still shone overhead, though they would soon be snuffed out by the rising sun. The night sky was not as Azir remembered it; the stars and the constellations were misaligned. Millennia had passed.\n\nWith every step, Azir's heavy staff of office struck a lonely note, echoing through the capital's empty streets.\n\nWhen last he had walked this path, an honor guard of 10,000 elite warriors had marched in his wake, and the cheers of the crowd had shaken the city. It was to have been his moment of glory \u2013 yet it had been stolen from him.\n\nNow, it was a city of ghosts. What had become of his people?\n\nWith an imperious gesture, Azir commanded the sands beside the roadway to rise, creating living statues. This was a vision of the past, the echoes of Shurima given form.\n\nThe sand figures looked forward, heads tilted toward the immense {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} hanging above the Dais of Ascension half a league ahead. It hung there still, declaring the glory and power of Azir's empire, though no one remained to see it. {{ci|Sivir|The daughter of Shurima}} who awakened him, she who bore his lineage, was gone. He sensed her out in the desert. Blood bound them together. \n\nAs Azir walked the Emperor's Way, the sand-echoes of his people pointed up at the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}, their joyful expressions turning to horror. Mouths opened wide in silent screams. They turned to run, stumbling and falling. Azir watched this all in despairing silence, bearing witness to the last moments of his people.\n\nThey were obliterated by a wave of unseen energy, reduced to dust and cast to the winds. What had gone wrong with his Ascension to unleash this catastrophe?\n\nAzir's focus narrowed. His march became more resolute. He reached the base of the Stairs of Ascension and began to climb, taking them five at a time.\n\nOnly his most trusted soldiers, the priesthood, and those of the royal bloodline were allowed to step foot upon the Stairs. Sand versions of these most favored subjects lined his path, faces upturned, grimacing and wailing in silence before they too were swept away by the winds.\n\nHe ran, taking the steps faster than any man could, talons digging into the stonework, carving furrows where they caught. Sand figures rose, and were then destroyed, to either side of him as he climbed.\n\nHe reached the top. Here, he saw the final circle of onlookers: his closest aides, his advisers, the high priests. His family.\n\nAzir dropped to his knees. His family was before him, rendered in perfect, heartbreaking detail. His wife, heavy with child. His shy daughter, clutching his wife's hand. His son, standing tall, on the brink of becoming a man.\n\nIn horror, Azir saw their expressions change. Though he knew what was to come, he could not look away. His daughter hid her face in the folds of his wife's dress; his son reached for his sword, shouting in defiance. His wife... her eyes widened, sorrow and despair writ within.\n\nThe unseen event blasted them to nothingness.\n\nIt was too much, but no tears welled in Azir's eyes. His [[Ascended]] form rendered that simple act of grief forever lost to him. With a heavy heart, he pushed himself to his feet. The question remained as to how {{ci|Sivir|his bloodline}} survived, for it most assuredly had.\n\nThe final echo awaited.\n\nHe advanced, halting one step below the Dais, and watched as it all played out before him, re-enacted in the sand.\n\nHe saw himself, in his mortal form, rise up into the air beneath the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}, arms wide and back arched. He remembered this moment. The power coursed through him, infusing his being, filling him with its divine strength.\n\nA newcomer formed in the sand. His trusted bondsman, his magus, {{ci|Xerath}}.\n\nHis friend uttered a silent word. Azir watched himself shatter like glass, exploding into motes of sand.\n\n''&quot;Xerath&quot;'', breathed Azir.\n\nThe traitor\u2019s expression was unknowable, but Azir could see nothing but the face of a murderer.\n\nWhere did such hate come from? Azir had never been aware of it.\n\nThe sand image of Xerath rose higher into the air as the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}}'s energies focused into his being. A cadre of elite guards rushed toward him, but they were all far too late.\n\nA brutal shockwave of sand flared out, disintegrating the final moment of Shurima. Azir stood alone among the dying echoes of his past.\n\nThis is what killed his people.\n\nAzir turned away, just as the first rays of the new dawn struck the {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} overhead. He'd seen enough. The sand image of the transformed Xerath collapsed behind him.\n\nThe dawn sun reflected blindingly off Azir's flawless golden armor. In that instant, he knew that the traitor still lived. He sensed the magus's essence in the air that he breathed.\n\nAzir lifted a hand, and {{ai|Arise!|Azir|an army of his elite warriors}} rose from the sands at the base of the Stairs of Ascension.\n\n''&quot;Xerath&quot;'', he said, his voice tinged with rage. ''&quot;Your crimes will not go unpunished.&quot;''\n\n&lt;gallery type = &quot;slideshow&quot; widths = &quot;640&quot; position = &quot;center&quot; crop = &quot;false&quot; hideaddbutton = &quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFall of the Empire 1.jpg\nFall of the Empire 2.jpg\nFall of the Empire 3.jpg\nFall of the Empire 4.jpg\nFall of the Empire 5.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "id": 268}, "Rumble": {"key": "Rumble", "name": "Rumble", "title": "the Mechanized Menace", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Rumble\n|alias        = * The Mechanized Menace\n* Dean Rumble\n* Junkyard Titan\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Junkyard Titan|Rumble|Tristy}}\n* {{ai|Flamespitter|Rumble}}\n* {{ai|Scrap Shield|Rumble}}\n* {{ai|Electro-Harpoon|Rumble}}\n|render       = [[File:Rumble_Render.png|link=|295px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Bandle City]]\n|occupation   = * Inventor\n* Mechanic\n* Defender of [[Bandle City]]\n* Founder and Dean of Rumble\u2019s Intense Training of Programmable Lab Suits\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Tristana, Ziggs\n|rivals       = Heimerdinger, Teemo, Tahm Kench\n|related      = \n}}\n", "background": "&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Ugh, it's gonna take forever to scrape your face off my suit!&quot;'' - {{ci|Rumble}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nEven amongst [[yordles]], Rumble was always the runt of the litter. As such, he was used to being bullied. In order to survive, he had to be scrappier and more resourceful than his peers. He developed a quick temper and a reputation for getting even, no matter who crossed him. This made him something of a loner, but he didn't mind. He liked to tinker, preferring the company of gadgets, and he could usually be found rummaging through the junkyard. \n\nHe showed great potential as a mechanic.

Torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility, she has crossed nearly all of [[Valoran]] on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers. Compelled by rumors of the rise of {{ci|Azir|a long-dead emperor}}, she returns to protect her tribe from dangers uncovered by Shurima's shifting sands. Some have mistaken her tender heart for weakness and paid the price for their error, for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth tremble.\n\n==Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\nMain=\nBorn in the rocky foothills bordering [[Icathia]]'s corrupted shadow, Taliyah spent her childhood herding goats with her tribe of nomadic weavers. Where most outsiders see Shurima as a beige and barren waste, her family raised her to be a true daughter of the desert and to see beauty in the rich hues of the land. Taliyah was always fascinated by the stone beneath the dunes. When she was a toddler, she collected colorful rocks as her people followed the seasonal waters. As she grew older, the earth itself seemed drawn to her, arcing and twisting to follow her tracks through the sand.\n\nAfter her sixth high summer, Taliyah wandered from the caravan in search of a lost goatling that had been placed in her charge. Determined not to disappoint her father - the master shepherd and headman of the tribe - she tracked the young animal into the night. She followed the hoofprints through a dry wash to a box canyon. The little beast had managed to get high up the rock wall, but could not get down.\n\nThe sandstone called to her, urging her to pull handholds from the sheer wall. Taliyah laid a tentative palm against the rock, determined to rescue the scared animal. The elemental power she felt was as urgent and overwhelming as a monsoon rain. As soon as she opened herself to the magic, it poured over her, the stone leaping to her fingertips, bringing both the canyon wall and the beast down on top of her.\n\nThe next morning, Taliyah's panicked father tracked the skittish bleats of the goatling. He fell to his knees when he found his daughter unconscious, covered loosely in a blanket of woven stone. Grief-stricken, he returned to the tribe with Taliyah.\n\nTwo days later, the girl awoke from fevered dreams in the tent of Babajan, the tribe's grandmother. Taliyah began to tell the wise woman and her concerned parents of her night in the canyon, of the rock that called to her. Babajan consoled the family, telling them that the patterns of rock were evidence the Great Weaver, the desert tribe's mythical protector, watched over the girl. In that moment, Taliyah saw her parents' deep worry and decided to conceal what really happened that night: that she - not the Great Weaver - had pulled at the desert stone.\n\nWhen children in Taliyah's tribe were old enough, they performed a dance under the face of the full moon, the manifestation of the Great Weaver herself. The dance celebrated the children's innate talents and demonstrated the gifts they would bring to the tribe as adults. This was the start of their path to true learning, as those children then became apprenticed to their teachers.\n\nTaliyah continued to hide her growing power, believing the secret she carried was a danger, not a blessing. She watched as her childhood playmates spun wool to keep the tribe warm on cold desert nights, demonstrated their skill with shears and dye, or wove patterns that told the stories of her people. On those nights, she would lie awake long after the coals had burned to ash, tormented by the power she felt stirring within.\n\nThe time finally came for Taliyah's dance beneath the full moon. While she had talent enough to be a capable shepherd like her father, or a pattern mistress like her mother, the young girl dreaded what her dance would truly reveal. As Taliyah took her place on the sand, the tools of her people - the shepherd's crook, the spindle, and the loom - surrounded her. She tried to concentrate on the task at hand, but it was the distant rocks, the layered colors of the land, that called to her. Taliyah closed her eyes and danced. Overwhelmed by the power flowing through her, she began to spin not thread, but the very earth beneath her feet.\n\nStartled cries from Taliyah's tribe broke her out of her spell. An imposing {{ai|Weaver's Wall|Taliyah|braid of sharp rock}} reached up to the light of the moon. Taliyah looked at the shocked faces of the people who surrounded her. Her will over the stone broken, the earthen tapestry crashed down. Taliyah's mother ran to her only daughter, to protect her from the falling rock. When the dust finally settled, Taliyah saw the destruction she had woven, the alarm on the faces of her tribe. But it was the small cut across her mother's face that justified Taliyah's fear. Though the cut was minor, Taliyah knew in that moment that she was a threat to the people she loved most in this world. She ran into the night, so weighed down by despair that the ground trembled beneath her feet.\n\nIt was her father who found her again in the desert. As they sat in the light of the rising sun, Taliyah confessed her secret in choked sobs. In turn, he did the only thing a parent could do: He hugged his daughter tightly. He told her that she couldn't run from her power, that she must complete her dance and see where her path would take her. Turning her back on the Great Weaver's gift was the only danger that could truly break his and her mother's heart.\n\nTaliyah returned with her father to the tribe. She entered the dancer's circle with her eyes open. This time, she wove a new {{ai|Weaver's Wall|Taliyah|ribbon of stone}}, each color and texture a memory of the people surrounding her.\n\nWhen it was over, the tribe sat in awe. Taliyah waited nervously. It was time for one of her people to stand as her teacher and claim the student. What felt like eons stretched between Taliyah's hammering heartbeats. She heard gravel shift as her father stood. Next to him, her mother stood. Babajan and the dye mistress and the master spinner stood. In a moment, the whole tribe was on its feet. All of them would stand with the girl who could weave stone.\n\nTaliyah looked at each of them. She knew that a power like hers had not been seen in generations, perhaps longer. They stood with her now, their love and trust surrounding her, but their worry was palpable. None among them heard the earth call as she did. As much as she loved these people, she did not see the one who could show her how to control the elemental magic that coursed within her. She knew that to stay with her tribe was to risk their lives. Though it pained all of them, Taliyah said farewell to her parents and her people, and set off alone into the world.\n\nShe journeyed west toward the distant peak of [[Targon]], her natural connection to rock drawing her toward the mountain that brushed the stars. However, at the northern edge of Shurima, it was those who marched beneath the banner of [[Noxus]] who discovered her power first. In Noxus, magic like hers was celebrated, they told her; revered, even. They promised her a teacher.\n\nThe land had raised Taliyah to be trusting, so she was unprepared for the smooth promises and practiced smiles of Noxian dignitaries. Soon, the desert girl found herself on an unbending path, passing under the many Noxtoraa, the great iron gates that marked the Empire's claim over a conquered land.\n\nThe crush of people and the layers of politics within the capital city were claustrophobic to a girl from the open desert. Taliyah was paraded through the tiers of Noxian magical society. Many took an interest in her power, its potential, but it was a fallen captain who swore to take her to a wild place across the sea, a place where she could hone her abilities without fear, who made the most convincing case. She accepted the young officer's offer and crossed the sea to [[Ionia]]. However, it was made clear as their ship dropped anchor that she was intended as a glorified weapon for a man desperate to regain his place at the highest ranks of the Noxian navy. At dawn, the captain gave her a choice: Bury a sleeping people in their homes, or be discarded in the surf.\n\nTaliyah looked across the bay. The cooking smoke had not yet risen from the village's sleeping hearths. This was not the lesson she had come so far to learn. Taliyah refused, and the captain threw her overboard to drown.\n\nShe escaped the tide and the fighting on the beach and found herself wandering, lost, in the wintry mountains of Ionia. It was there she finally discovered her {{ci|Yasuo|teacher}}, a man whose blade harnessed the wind itself, someone who understood the elements and the need for balance. She trained with him for a time and began to find the control she had long sought.\n\nWhile resting at an isolated inn, Taliyah heard that the [[Ascended]] {{ci|Azir|Emperor of Shurima}} had returned to his desert kingdom. Rumor had it this emperor turned god sought to gather his people, the disparate tribes, back to him as slaves. Even with her training unfinished, there was no other choice; she knew she must return to her family to protect them. Sadly, she and her mentor parted ways.\n\nTaliyah returned home to the sand-swept dunes of Shurima. As the punishing rays of the sun beat down on her, Taliyah pushed farther into the desert, determined to find her people. Hers was a will of stone, and she would do whatever was necessary to protect her family and her tribe from the danger that loomed on the horizon.\n\n", "id": 163}, "Teemo": {"key": "Teemo", "name": "Teemo", "title": "the Swift Scout", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Teemo\n|alias        = * The Swift Scout\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Blinding Dart|Teemo}}\n* {{ai|Toxic Shot|Teemo|Toxic Dart}}\n* {{ai|Noxious Trap|Teemo|Mushroom}}\n|render       = [[File:Teemo Render.png|link=|240px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Bandle City]]\n|occupation   = * Scout\n* &lt;small&gt;(Member of the Omega Squad{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Tristana\n|rivals       = Veigar, Rumble, Tahm Kench\n|related      = * [http://skins.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/omegasquad/ War Changes a Yordle: Omega Squad]\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\nTeemo is a legend among his [[yordle]] brothers and sisters in [[Bandle City]]. As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite his genuinely warm personality, something switches off inside Teemo's mind during combat so that the lives he must end while on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo's superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership, which is one of Bandle City's most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling Commandos.\n\nWhile most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of the most dangerous yordles alive, though you'd never know it by having a cup of honey mead with him at his favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first [[champion]] for [[the League]], and he has taken to it like a duck to water. His signature weapon - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles of [[Kumungu]]. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently struck up a friendship with {{ci|Tristana}}, a fellow League champion and fellow member of Bandle City's Special Forces. This connection is healthy for both yordles, though now [[Valoran|Valoran's]] voracious media outlets circulate rumors that the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship.

By this time, his hands had been ruined and he could barely walk. Scythe-like grafts affixed to his maimed limbs served to carry out his bloody work.\n\n'''Urgot''' finally met his end at what should have been his finest hour.

Those who claim to have seen him describe Amumu as a living cadaver, small in stature and covered in {{ai|Bandage Toss|Amumu|bandages the color of lichen}}. Amumu has inspired myths, folklore, and legends told and retold for generations - such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.\n\n==Lore==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\nThe hardy folk of Shurima agree upon certain things: the wind always blows from the west in the morning; a full belly on a new moon is an ill omen; buried treasure hides under the heaviest of rocks. They do not agree, however, about the tale of Amumu.\n\nOne oft-told story links Amumu to the first great ruling family of Shurima who succumbed to a disease that corrupted flesh with hideous speed. The youngest child, Amumu, was quarantined in his chambers and befriended a servant girl who heard his cries through the walls. She regaled the lonely heir with courtly news and stories of her grandmother's mystic powers.\n\nOne morning, the girl brought word that Amumu's last remaining brother had passed away, making him Emperor of Shurima. Saddened that he had to bear this news alone, she unlocked his door and ran inside to comfort him face to face. Amumu threw his arms around her, but as they touched, he fell back, realizing he had condemned}} her to the same terrible fate as his family.\n\nUpon the girl's death, her grandmother placed a twisted blight on the young emperor. In her mind, Amumu had as good as murdered her kin. As the curse took effect, Amumu was trapped in his moment of {{ai|Despair|Amumu|suffering}} like a locust ensnared in honeyed amber.\n\nA second tale whispers of another crown prince, one given to bouts of petulance, cruelty, and murderous vanity. In this telling, Amumu was crowned Emperor of Shurima at a young age, and convinced he was blessed by the sun, he forced his subjects to worship him as a god.\n\nAmumu sought the fabled Eye of Angor, an ancient relic entombed in a gilded crypt, said to grant eternal life to whoever looked upon it with an unflinching heart. He hunted the treasure for years with a host of slaves who carried him through labyrinthine catacombs, sacrificing themselves to traps so the emperor could continue without hindrance. Amumu finally reached the cyclopean golden archway, where upon dozens of his stonemasons labored to breach the sealed door.\n\nAs the young emperor rushed within, determined to look into the Eye of Angor, his slaves seized their chance and sealed the stone doorway behind him. Some say the child emperor endured in the darkness for years, his loneliness driving him to insanity and causing him to claw at his own skin, which he was forced to wrap in bandages. His life was extended by the power of the Eye as he meditated on his past transgressions, but the gift was a double edged sword, for he was cursed to remain forever alone.\n\nWhen a series of devastating earthquakes shattered the foundations of his tomb, the emperor escaped with no knowledge of how much time had passed, seeking to undo the suffering he had caused in life.\n\nYet another story of Amumu tells of the first and last [[Yordle]] ruler of Shurima, who believed in the innate goodness of the human heart. To prove his detractors wrong, he swore an oath to live as a beggar until he made one true friend, convinced his people would rally to help their fellow Shuriman.\n\nThough thousands walked by the disheveled Yordle, not one stopped to offer a helping hand. Amumu's {{ai|Despair|Amumu|sadness}} grew until he eventually died of a broken heart. But his death was not the end, for some swear the Yordle still wanders the desert, forever searching for someone who might restore his faith in humanity.\n\nThese stories, despite their differences, are woven with parallels. Whatever the circumstances, Amumu is doomed to exist in a broken state of emptiness, eternally alone and friendless. Fated to forever search for a companion, his presence is cursed and his touch is death. On long winter nights when the fire is never allowed to burn low, the sad mummy can sometimes be heard weeping in the desert, {{ai|Despair|Amumu|despairing}} that he'll never know the solace of friendship.\n\nWhatever Amumu searches for - atonement, kinship, or a single act of kindness - one thing is as certain as the western wind at dawn: he has yet to find it.\n\n;Greed and Tears\n''&quot;The gods were angry, and shook the land. Cracks rent the earth&quot;'', said old Khaldun, his crag-featured face lit by firelight. ''&quot;It was into one of these fissures that a young man ventured. He found an opening; the entrance to a tomb, hidden for {{ci|Nasus|the Jackal}} knows how long. The man had little ones to feed and a wife to please, and so he ventured in, lured by opportunity.&quot;''\n\nAdults and children alike crowded in close to hear the old storyteller's words. They were all weary - they had traveled far that day, and the [[Shurima]]n sun had been unrelenting - but Khaldun's tales were a rare treat. They drew their cloaks tight around their shoulders against the chill of the night and leaned in.\n\n''&quot;The air was cool in the tomb, a merciful relief from the scorching heat outside. The young man lit a torch. Its light made shadows dance before him. He stepped cautiously, wary of traps. He was poor, but he was no fool.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The walls inside were smooth obsidian and carved with ancient writings and images. He could not read - he was a simple man - but he studied the images.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He saw {{ci|Amumu|a boy prince}}, sitting cross-legged upon a {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|sun disc}} borne by a team of servants, a beaming smile upon his face. Chests of coins and riches were piled before him, the offerings of strangely garbed, bowing emissaries.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He saw other carvings, again showing the smiling prince, this time walking among his people. Their heads were pressed to the ground before him. Stylized rays of sunshine radiated from the boy's crown.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Before one of these images was a small, gold statue. It alone was worth more than he could have hoped to earn in ten lifetimes. The young man took it, slipping it into his satchel.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He did not intend to linger. He knew it would not be long before others came upon this place. When they did, he wanted to be gone. Greed makes fools of even the greatest men, and he knew that others would willingly spill his blood to claim that golden statue - and the other riches that were surely further in. Avarice was not one of the young man's faults, however. He felt no need to delve further. The other treasures hidden here were someone else's to claim.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He looked upon one last image before he left the tomb. It showed the boy prince dead, lying upon a bier. Those closest to him were wailing... but further back, people were celebrating. Had the boy prince been beloved, or had he been a tyrant? There was no way of knowing.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That was when he heard it: a sound in the darkness that made his skin crawl.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He looked around, wide eyed, holding his torch up before him. Nothing.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Who's there?' he said. Silence was his only answer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The young man shook his head. 'It is just the wind, you fool', he thought. 'Nothing but the wind.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then he heard it again, more distinctly this time. A child was crying in the darkness further into the tomb.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Heard anywhere else, his paternal instinct would have been to go to the sound. But here, in the darkness of a funeral tomb?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He wanted to run... but he did not. The sobbing touched his heart. It was filled with such misery and grief.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Was it possible there was another entrance to this tomb? Had a young boy found his way down here and become lost?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Torch held high, he crept forward. The weeping continued, echoing faintly through the gloom.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;A wide chamber opened before him, its floor black and highly reflective. Golden artifacts and jewel-inlaid walls glinted within. Gingerly, he entered the room.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He stepped back sharply as his heel sent ripples spreading out across the floor. {{ai|Despair|Amumu|Water}}. The floor was not made of reflective obsidian - it was covered in water.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Kneeling, he scooped a handful of it to his lips. He spat it out immediately. It was salt water! Here, in the heart of Shurima, a thousand leagues from the nearest sea!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He heard the sound of the boy weeping once more, closer now.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Holding his torch before him, the young man glimpsed a shape at the edge of its light. It appeared to be the child, sitting with his back to the man.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Carefully, he stepped into the room. The water upon the floor was not deep. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and fear clutched at his chest, yet he did not turn to run.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Are you lost?' he asked, as he stepped closer. 'How did you get here?'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The shadowed figure did not turn... but he did speak.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'I... I don't remember', he said. The sound swam around the young man, echoing off the walls. The boy spoke in an old dialect. His words were strange... but understandable. 'I don't remember who I am.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Be calm, child', said the man. 'All will be well.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He stepped closer, and the figure resolved itself before him. His eyes widened.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The shape before him was a god-statue carved in onyx, nothing more. It was not the source of the crying, nor of the child's voice.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;That was when a small, dry hand grabbed him.&quot;''\n\nThe youngest of the listeners gasped, his eyes wide. The other children laughed in false bravado. Old Khaldun smiled, a golden tooth glinting in the firelight. Then, he continued.\n\n''&quot;The young man looked down. The linen-wrapped corpse of the tiny prince stood beside the man. Dull, ghostly light emanated from the deathly boy's eye sockets, though his entire face was bound in burial wrappings. The corpse-child held the man's hand.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'Will you be my friend?' the boy asked, his voice muffled by linen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;The young man lurched backward, breaking free of the child's grasp. The young man looked down at his arm in horror; his hand was shriveling, turning black and withered. {{ai|Cursed Touch|Amumu|The wasting touch}} then began to climb up his arm.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He turned and ran. In his shock and haste, he dropped his lantern. It hissed as it fell into the lake of tears, and darkness descended. Still, he could just make out the glow of daylight up ahead. He ran toward it, scrambling desperately, even as the wasting death crept up his arm towards his heart.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;At any moment, he expected to feel the deathly boy's grasp upon him... but did not. After what felt like an eternity, but could only have been a matter of heartbeats, he burst from the darkness into the desert heat once more.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'I'm sorry', echoed a mournful voice from the gloom behind him. 'I didn\u2019t mean to.'&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And thus, the Tomb of Amumu was unearthed&quot;'', said old Khaldun, ''&quot;and the deathly child released into the world.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;But everyone knows he isn't real!&quot;'' cried one of the children, the oldest of them, after a moment of silence.\n\n''&quot;Amumu is real!&quot;'' said the youngest. ''&quot;He's wandering the land trying to find a friend!&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He's real, but he isn't a boy&quot;'', said another. ''&quot;He's a [[Yordle]]!&quot;''\n\nKhaldun laughed, and pushed himself to his feet with the aid of a gnarled walking stick.\n\n''&quot;I am old, and we have far to travel tomorrow&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;It is past time I was abed.&quot;''\n\nHis audience began to dissipate, smiling and talking in low, familial voices, but one child did not move. She stared at Khaldun, unblinking.\n\n''&quot;Grandfather&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;How did you lose your arm?&quot;''\n\nOld Khaldun looked down at the empty sleeve pinned at his shoulder, then flashed the girl a grin.\n\n''&quot;Goodnight, little one&quot;'', he said with a wink.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 32}, "Galio": {"key": "Galio", "name": "Galio", "title": "the Sentinel's Sorrow", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Galio\n|alias = The Sentinel's Sorrow\n|render = Galio Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race =  Magical Construct &lt;small&gt;(Gargoyle)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]]\n|residence = [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Poppy, Kayle, Shyvana\n|enemies = Sion\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;There is no such thing as redemption.

Now forbidden, instilling golems with reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more expert of craftsmen. One such visionary was the [[Demacia]]n artificer, Durand.\n\nPeerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand's constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their [[Noxus|Noxian]] neighbors. For his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum opus: Galio.\n\nThis mighty construct forged in the image of a gargoyle kept him safe on his journeys, allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those hostile to his homeland. That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\n\nAs Durand crossed the [[Howling Marsh]] with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in force. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists.\n\nStripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired. For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame. Then, on one nondescript day, a sad but determined {{ci|Poppy|yordle girl}} carrying a mighty [[Demacia]]n crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest.\n\nHidden in plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn [[yordle]]. She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia.\n\nThis encounter lit a spark in Galio's eye. Remembering the cause that his master had died defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake of this brave creature.

She chooses each target carefully, waits for the right moment, and then strikes with power and precision. It is with this same vision and focus that she pursues her goal of uniting the tribes of the [[Freljord]] and forging them into a mighty nation.\n\n==Lore==\nAs a child, Ashe was always a dreamer. She marveled at the colossal, abandoned fortresses of her ancestors, and spent hours by the fire listening to tales of the Freljord's fabled champions. Most of all she loved the legend of Avarosa, the renowned Queen of the once magnificent and united Freljord. Though her mother chided her foolishness, Ashe swore one day she would join the scattered and warlike tribes of the tundra. She knew in her heart that if her people would stand together once more, they would reach greatness again.\n\nWhen Ashe was only fifteen, her mother was killed while commanding the tribe on a brash raid. Suddenly thrust into the role of leader, Ashe made the difficult decision to follow her childhood vision instead of seeking the revenge she craved. She spoke passionately against her tribe's demand for retribution, declaring the time had come to put blood feuds aside and broker a lasting peace. Some of her warriors questioned her fitness to rule and soon hatched a treasonous plot to kill the young leader.\n\nThe assassins struck while Ashe was on a routine hunt, but their plan was interrupted by the warning cry of a great hawk. Ashe looked back to see her tribesmen approaching with swords drawn. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Ashe ran for hours. She found herself deep in uncharted territory, her weapon lost in the chase. When she heard another cry from the hawk, Ashe put her faith in the strange creature and followed it to a clearing. There she found the bird perched on a pile of stones - an ancient Freljord burial cairn. With a last glance at her, the hawk screeched and flew away. Approaching the mound, Ashe felt her breath turn to frost and an unnatural cold chill her to the bone. The stone at the top of the cairn was marked with a single rune: Avarosa.\n\nThe assassins burst into the clearing. Ashe lifted the runestone from the cairn to defend herself, revealing something hidden underneath: an ornate bow carved from ice. She grasped it, crying out in pain as frost formed on her fingers, and tore the bow from its resting place. Cold flowed from the enchanted weapon into Ashe, awakening a tremendous power that had always lived within her.\n\nAshe turned to face the assassins. She drew the bow, and by sheer instinct, willed arrows of pure ice to form from the cold, crisp air. With a single {{ai|Volley|Ashe|frozen volley}}, she ended the insurrection. Carefully replacing the cairn stone, she gave thanks to Avarosa for her gift, and returned home. Ashe's tribe immediately recognized the legendary weapon in the archer's hand as a blessing from the ancient Freljord queen herself.\n\nWith Avarosa's bow and her vision of peaceful unification, Ashe's tribe soon swelled, becoming the largest in the Freljord. Now known as the [[File:ProfileIcon Avarosan.png|20px|link=]] Avarosan, they stand together with the belief that a united Freljord will once again become a great nation.\n\n{{sm2|Freljord- Avarosan Ashe.ogg|''&quot;It is our duty to speak of unity, here among the ruins of our past.

My analysis suggests this habitat was a place of great magic; I'm not surprised it was a target of such destruction. There is something compelling about the tower. While the others are off scavenging, I enter the citadel.\n\nCryptic instruments are strewn about. I examine one. Another flash of hot magenta light, another dust pile.\n\nFascinating: a tool to alter their concept of time.\n\nStrange.\n\nUnprecedented.\n\nFrom the state of the tower, it seems {{ci|Zilean|the owner}} departed only recently. The artifacts left behind have existed in more than one time and place. Some are more complex than others; all are more impressive than anything I have seen on this plane. Clearly, the owner knows things I have not encountered in any of my travels.\n\nI require such knowledge.\n\nLeaving the tower, I find the others closing in on the entrance, ready to destroy it as they have destroyed everything else we have met. They will only get in the way of my goal. There are some things [[the Void]] should not consume indiscriminately.\n\nWithout warning, I lash out a tentacle, its tip glowing white hot. {{ai|Void Rift|Vel'Koz|Lightning}} arcs through the first creature, knocking it back. Its screams fade as I extend all three limbs, energy crackling between them, scorching the air where the streams meet. The other two run; they know what's coming.\n\nMust they always flee?\n\nI open my eye wide and unleash {{ai|Lifeform Disintegration Ray|Vel'Koz|a beam of energy}}, following the escaping creatures. They are instantly reduced to ash. ''&quot;Hmm. Void-native melting point is inconsistent&quot;'', I note.\n\nBut that is of no consequence. The hunger inside me grows. I am ravenous. Insatiable, as never before.\n\nI have glimpsed the ultimate knowledge.\n\nAnd I will have it.\n\n", "id": 161}, "Singed": {"key": "Singed", "name": "Singed", "title": "the Mad Chemist", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Singed\n|alias        = * The Mad Chemist\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Empowered Bulwark|Singed|Riot Shield}}\n* {{ai|Poison Trail|Singed|Poison Gas}}\n* {{ai|Mega Adhesive|Singed}}\n|render       = [[File:Singed Render.png|link=|230px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = [[Zaun]]\n|residence    = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation   = * Zaunite chemist\n* Noxian military supplier\n|faction      = * [[Zaun]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Warwick, Viktor\n|enemies      = Irelia, Riven, Master Yi\n|related=}}\n== Lore ==\n&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.---&gt;\n:''This lore is out-dated and is no longer considered {{w|canon}}.''\nSinged descended from a long line of [[Zaun]]'s revered chemists. Even in his youth, his talent for concocting potions far outstripped that of his peers, and he quickly distinguished himself from his less extraordinary chemist compatriots. It came as no surprise to anyone when he was selected for apprenticeship by the infamous {{ci|Warwick}}, master apothecary on a lucrative retainer with the [[Noxian]] military during their campaign against [[Ionia]]. Within Warwick's laboratories, Singed toiled without end, rapidly absorbing every detail of his predecessor's deadly craft. Singed had little concern for the death and destruction that was the fruit of his labors. By the time the curse of lycanthropy descended to claim his master, Singed was poised and eager to make the transition from workhorse to innovator; he was ready to share his genius by bringing a new brand of suffering to the Ionian front. His zeal for progress was unquenchable, and when suitable test subjects proved to be in short supply, the eager chemist was often thought to turn his volatile mixtures on his own flesh.\n\nWhen the uneasy peace created by [[the League of Legends]] settled on the world, Singed journeyed to the one place where he was still able to showcase his beloved craft: the [[Institute of War]]. By this time he was barely even a man, his body both ruined and sustained by his ingenious craft. A thousand burns &amp;ndash; accidents of shadow and flame &amp;ndash; mark his ravaged form, and exposure to such harsh conditions has deadened his nerves, hardened his body, and strengthened his physique, transforming him into a veritable juggernaut. This, combined with a formidable arsenal of deadly concoctions, make Singed a force to be reckoned with on the [[Fields of Justice]]. \n\n{{quote|&quot;My deadliest dose shall bear my patron's name!&quot;|'''{{ci|Singed}}''', having just christened the {{ai|Insanity Potion|Singed}}}}\n{{clr}}\n== Quotes ==\n;Upon selection\n* {{sm2|Singed Select.ogg|''&quot;How about a drink?&quot;''}}\n\n;Movement/Attacking\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack1.ogg|''&quot;This may hurt.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack2.ogg|''&quot;Mix, mix, swirl, mix.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack3.ogg|''&quot;It's nearly time.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack4.ogg|''&quot;To shake, or not to shake.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack5.ogg|''&quot;I hear you.&quot;''}}\n* {{sm2|Singed.attack6.ogg|''&quot;On my way.&quot;''}}\n\n;Taunt\n* {{sm2|Singed.taunt.ogg|''&quot;How'd that taste?&quot;''}}\n\n;Joke\n* {{sm2|Singed.joke.ogg|''&quot;Shaken, not stirred.&quot;''}}\n\n;Laugh\n* {{sm2|ChemicalMan.laugh1.ogg|''Singed laughs.''}}\n* {{sm2|ChemicalMan.laugh2.ogg|''Singed laughs.''}}\n* {{sm2|ChemicalMan.laugh3.ogg|''Singed laughs.''}}\n\n== Development ==\n''{{ci|Singed}} was designed jointly by [[Ezreal (person)|Ezreal]] and [[Guinsoo]]''.\n&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;640&quot; position=&quot;center&quot; crop=&quot;false&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nSinged OriginalSkin old.jpg|1st Classic Singed splash art\nSinged HextechSkin old.jpg|1st Hextech Singed splash art\nSinged Concept 1.jpg|Singed VU concept art 1 (by Riot Artist [http://soul71.deviantart.com/ Augie Pagan])\nSinged concept.jpg|Singed VU concept art 2 (by Riot Artist [http://soul71.deviantart.com/ Augie Pagan])\nSinged VU concept 01.jpg|Singed VU concept art 3 \nSinged VU concept 02.jpg|Singed VU concept art 4 (by Riot Artist [http://soul71.deviantart.com/ Augie Pagan])\nSinged VU concept 03.jpg|Singed VU concept art 5\nSinged ability concept old.jpg|Singed old ability concept art (by Riot Artist [https://www.behance.net/gallery/18491651/League-of-Legends Albert Carranza])\nSinged Render old.png|Old Singed model\nSinged concept 3.jpg|Singed VU concept art (by Riot Artist [http://devindraleonis.deviantart.com/gallery/ Josh Singh])\nSinged SSW concept.jpg|SSW Singed concept art (by Riot Artist [[Sunny Koda]])\nSinged BlackScourge concept.jpg|Black Scourge Singed concept (by Riot Artist [[Cody 'Sstrikerr' Bunt]])\nSinged BlackScourge model.jpg|Black Scourge Singed model (by Riot Artist [[Cody 'Sstrikerr' Bunt]])\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n=== Champion Update &lt;small&gt;(Visual)&lt;/small&gt;: Singed ===\nBy '''SIXTWO''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-singed Champion Update: Singed]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n''We\u2019ve got a few relatively smaller champion updates coming out in the wake of Sion\u2019s grand arrival.

We cannot be shattered.&quot;'' - {{ci|Skarner}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nSkarner is an immense crystalline scorpion from a hidden valley in [[Shurima]]. Part of the ancient Brackern race, Skarner and his kin are known for their great wisdom and deep connection to the land, as their souls are fused with powerful {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|life crystals}} which hold the living thoughts and memories of their ancestors. In an age long past, the Brackern entered hibernation to avoid untold magical destruction, but recent, threatening events have roused Skarner. As the only Brackern awake, he strives to protect his kind from those who seek to harm them.\n\n==Lore==\nLong before men traversed the scorched deserts of Shurima, the very sand itself shone with primal, unchained magic. In a remote valley surrounded by steep cliffs and jagged rock formations, the age-old race of Brackern unearthed {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|raw crystals}} from deep within the sand. Each of these noble creatures fused with a single stone, which retained their consciousness long after their death.\n\nThe demise of a Brackern was a rare occurrence, as their worldly lives stretched across millennia, but even death did not signify an ending. When a creature's mortal form perished, its life stone was buried in the valley for safekeeping until a new Brackern could uncover it. This practice protected the vulnerable crystals while preserving the wisdom of the ones who came before.\n\nWith a finite number of stones, the young Brackern searched for the crystal meant for them, just as the consciousness within the stone beckoned to the Brackern it had chosen to inherit its magic and memories. In a sacred rite, the rock fused with {{ai|Crystalline Exoskeleton|Skarner|crystalline flesh}}, imbuing the creature's mind with memories and knowledge and flooding them with primal magic. A Brackern without a crystal would not long survive, for they lacked the strength, longevity, and power instilled by the stones.\n\nThe young creature named Skarner spent many years searching for the crystal meant for him. Afraid he would die before finding it, he grew more persistent in his search with each passing moon. Day and night, he delved deep into the ground, digging in a methodical pattern that covered the entire valley and neighboring hills with intricate spirals.\n\nSkarner had all but given up when he finally felt an ancient consciousness tugging at his mind. He burrowed down, venturing ever deeper until the world's heart warmed his shell. Days passed, but the consciousness grew ever more insistent as it urged him onward. Skarner's pincers closed on a well-worn stone, and he heard a rasping whisper at the back of his mind. Though the voice was faint, he already felt intimately connected to its awareness, and he knew he had found his stone.\n\nThe crystal was larger than any he had seen, and so timeworn that its glow had faded to a soft glimmer. Its surface was cracked in several places and dulled from eons buried under the ground. Skarner examined the rock with the tenderest touch, afraid of further damaging something so ancient. The dim glow within pulsed as though breathing in response to Skarner's presence.\n\nSkarner began the bonding ritual, burying himself deep underground with the crystal for weeks without sustenance. Though he ached with fatigue and his limbs atrophied in starvation, he was not afraid, for the voice within the stone comforted him. When the crystal finally fused with his body, he was overwhelmed with emotion as ancient memories and wisdom permeated his thoughts. He witnessed moments of incredible joy and crushing sorrow from generations long deceased. He felt magic all around him, suffusing his body with a deep connection to the world through a low constant hum, and sensed his kind communicating in a wordless meeting of minds.\n\nWhen the cataclysmic forces of the Rune Wars began to devastate the world, the Brackern feared the turmoil would soon mark the end of their species. They resolved to hide in hibernation until humans wiped themselves out, as it seemed certain they would. Only then would it be safe to emerge from the sands once more.\n\nThe crystalline scorpions buried themselves deep in the Shuriman desert with the youngest and most ferocious positioned closest to the surface, ready to awaken first and defend the others in case of danger. The strength Skarner gained from his ancient life stone made him more powerful than almost all of his kin, so he was one of the last of his kind to enter the long slumber.\n\nThey slept in peaceful isolation as centuries passed before Skarner awoke from his shallow burrow in a panic. Deafening explosions shattered the ground, targeting the Brackern where they lay sleeping and stunning those closest to the surface. A band of robbers had discovered the dormant creatures and were prying crystals from crystalline flesh. Skarner, protected from the brunt of the attack by his crystal, erupted from the sand in a terrible frenzy of {{ai|Crystal Slash|Skarner|sharp pincers}} and {{ai|Impale|Skarner|poisonous stabs}}. Though their numbers all but overwhelmed him, he killed many of the thieves, and the rest fled in terror. Skarner was horrified to learn he was the only one awake, and that many of his people's crystals had already been stolen.\n\nSkarner tried to revive his dormant companions, but the men had broken so many life stones in their thoughtless theft that several Brackern with damaged crystals died moments after Skarner woke them, while others would not wake at all. For weeks Skarner paced the sand above his sleeping brethren in sorrowful mourning. He was certain the crystals would quickly perish in the hands of men, and mourned their loss too.\n\nYet as the sun broke over the horizon many weeks later, Skarner heard distant echoes calling in his mind. The cries were faint, but rang clear over the land. These voices of the lost stones reached out to him in terror, imploring Skarner to reconnect them with their kind. Skarner hesitated, torn as to whether he should rescue the lost crystals or continue guarding the still-living Brackern. After weeks spent erasing all traces of the excavation, he could not stand to hear the minds of his kin suffering at the hands of the violent humans, and resolved to set out to save the missing crystals.\n\nSkarner began the arduous task of tracking the stones, hoping no others would discover his kin beneath the sand. Though his search is lonely, he occasionally hears a lost crystal calling to him, a feeling that brings joy and anguish in equal measure. He focuses his sorrow into unshakable determination, and refuses to rest until he has recovered every last life stone.\n\n;Dreamsong\nThe softskins broke our slumber of a thousand spins.\n\nFor many long ages, I sensed the world's dizzying movement. Stars exploded and died above me, though I did not see them. I felt the warmth of the sun flood the sand with life.\n\nWhen my heartpulse slowed and I curled in the dry sand to warm my body for longsleep, I thought my time below would be lonely, that the earth would not respond to my touch. But all around me were kin. I sensed them rustling in their slumber. I listened to their silent murmurs reaching for my mind. I heard their dreamsongs of worlds upon worlds. A place without softskins, without fear or pain or doubt. A place of great peace.\n\nIn the sand, we were all connected; we dreamed as one. Not just the singers, but all living things; the worms curling around smooth rockgrains, the molerats burrowing tunnels to birth their young, even a family of fur-soft spiderlings who rested for a night in the deepdark.\n\nI thought the rocks would be immobile, cold, uncaring. But they, too, were part of us. The stones were warm, and the deeper we burrowed, the closer we got to this world's wombfire. Each time the underground boiled in rage, I was there; its tremors shook the sand until I sang back with my own anger. ''We are one, we are all. Your anger is as mine.'' I heard its gratitude in the raintime when wet drops soaked the sand and the earth grew fat and full.\n\nWhen the softskins came, the ground knew only pain. Our songs became cries as we were torn and broken and scattered. I heard the sorrowsong as the softskins unearthed my kin. They tore {{ai|Crystal Spires|Skarner|crystal namestones}} from our bodies as we screamed, louder than earthshakes, and stole them away. I sang long into the many nights, sang until my heart was empty and cold, but they did not return.\n\nToday, I am alone in the aboveplace. Today, the dry wind burns my skin. With every step, the sand grinds against me in protest. I fight my urge to bury myself down, down, to go inside the earth's deepdark. ''I am not apart. I am part of the one, not beyond.''\n\nFrom far away, a song of painfear reaches me. The tone is faint, but I recognize the melody, and I send out a song of my sorrow. A note of hope rings back in my mind, clear and fine. ''Almost, almost.''\n\nAnother set of stars whirl overhead, and again. The endlessly blinking universe stares down at me. I feel moltenheavy with the weight of above. ''I should be down, but I am here, alone in the cold air.''\n\nI have been above for three moons. A blink of an eye, a sliver of existence. A warming murmur passes silently underground - yet in the aboveplace, I feel the eternity of alone.\n\nAhead, I hear softskins. They do not sing, they shout. Their tones scratch and clash without melody or cohesion. They burn meatflesh over a falsefire. Its fat smokes the air and I choke on the stench. ''Why would they do such a thing? The ground is plenty, plenty for all.''\n\nThe melody calls to me weakly. ''Almost.'' The namestone is close.\n\nI must explain; the softskins do not understand. Their race is but three turns young; they have only begun to dig; they have barely uncoiled the beginnings of underneath. They speak, but I have not yet heard them sing. ''They will learn.''\n\nI sing in their minds a song of the calmland, so they feel the great beauty that awaits us when we sleep. I sing for my dead kin, so they know what they stole.\n\nThe softskins do not sing back. They do not seem to hear me so my voice grows louder in their heads. I sing for our namestones, wrongfully taken. ''Bring them back, they are ours. You murdered one cluster already. Do not deny our future also.'' I sing a plea. ''Let me carry the crystals to the deepdark, so they can bind with us again.'' I sing to heal this tearing wound.\n\nThe softskins are still shouting to each other. One of them releases a rhythmic sound... a laugh? I feel as though my body is being crushed by the air, so I burrow. I am comforted by the weight around me.\n\nHow can they not see the ruin they've caused? ''You are heartless, you are crude. How could you sever us like this?''\n\n{{ai|Crystalline Exoskeleton|Skarner|My husk glows skywhite}} with rage. ''I will not let these softskins destroy us.''\n\nI hear them scream as I erupt from the sand. I summon energy from the ground and store the power in my namestone. A softskin throws a splinterblade and it hits my leg, shattering on my lucent shell. ''You sing only death. I, too, can sing this song.'' I release sunbright energy and {{ai|Fracture|Skarner|sharp crystals}} burst from the ground, impaling flesh and cracking spines.\n\nThe falsefire spreads in their panic. Their crude structures of twig and hide burn through the darkness, carrying softskins into the flames. Smoke rises in an offering to the blinking stars. Softskins run from the chaos, but I am faster. I circle around them and lash out at a straggler, slicing his middle apart with {{ai|Crystal Slash|Skarner|my claw}}. I crush another underfoot. Lifeblood stains the sand. I roar in grief, not a song but a cry. ''Your blood is not worthy to touch the one and the all.''\n\nMy tail lashes left and right and I knock the softskins down. I summon the sunbright once again, and more crystals spike from the sand to pierce flesh. ''So you can hear my song, after all...''\n\nI am crude like them. I am violence. I am death.\n\nWhen I dream I see only rage. ''I am no longer worthy of the deepdark. But I cannot stop.''\n\nOnly one remains. The softskin fumbles with a glowing thing of wood and metal. ''She means to kill me.'' A false sun blazes from the thing and punctures my hardshell, burning my insides. The light reflects inside my crystal, paralyzing me. I stagger in agonizing pain. ''I cannot move. I am broken. I am ended.''\n\nA fading song rings in my mind. ''Almost, almost. We are one.''\n\nShe aims her weapon again and I shake with horror as I see the paling namestone strapped to it. ''Her weapon drains our life energy. They are wasting crystals to power their terrible song.'' I feel I will burst in fury and pain, but instead I pull strength from the ground. I cry out and lash with {{ai|Impale|Skarner|my sting}}, impaling the softskin as she writhes like a worm. I grasp the weapon and crush it with a claw. It crumbles to dust, leaving only the skywhite namestone.\n\nI hold the crystal in my mouth where it will be safe. ''I am here, we are one.''\n\nI curl my stinger and she falls. ''Do not return. Do not take our namestones. We are not yours. We are all. We belong only to the deepdark.''\n\nI leave her alive and she runs. She lives not with my mercy, but because I know she has heard my dreamsong, and she has no choice but to sing.\n\n", "id": 72}, "Varus": {"key": "Varus", "name": "Varus", "title": "the Arrow of Retribution", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Varus\n|alias        = * The Arrow of Retribution\n|render       =\nVarus Render.png\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically corrupted)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Ionia]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation   = * Unknown\n*&lt;s&gt;Guardian of the Pit of Pallas&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|enemies      = Riven\n|related      = \n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The life of an arrow is fleeting, built of nothing but direction and intent.&quot;'' - {{ci|Varus}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nFor his incomparable skill with the bow and his unquestioned sense of honor, Varus was chosen to be the warden of a sacred [[Ionian]] temple. The temple was built to contain an ancient pit of corruption so vile that Ionian Elders feared it could envelop the island in darkness. Varus prided himself on his position, as only the most exceptional Ionian warriors were selected for the role. He lived with his family in a nearby village and led a quiet life of disciplined routine until the day the forces of [[Noxus]] invaded Ionia. Their shock troops left nothing but death and desolation in their wake, and the temple lay in their path. Varus was forced to make a decision. He was bound by honor to stay and defend the temple, but without him the village's few inhabitants could offer little resistance against the oncoming war machine. Gravely, he chose to fulfill his duty as a warden. The corruption could not be allowed to escape.\n\nHis arrows sundered the troops who tried to wrest the temple from him that day. However, when he returned to his village, he found that it had been reduced to a smoldering graveyard. Remorse at the sight of his slain family gave way to overwhelming regret and then to seething hatred. He swore to slaughter every Noxian invader, but first he needed to become stronger. He turned to that which he had sacrificed everything to protect. The pit of corruption would consume him wholly, as a flame devours a wick, but its abominable power would burn within him until he was lost. This was a path from which there could be no return. With grim resolve, he condemned himself to the black flames, feeling malevolent energy bond to his skin... and with it, the promise of ruin. He left, seeking the blood of all Noxians involved with the invasion, a grisly task that eventually led him to the invasion's most infamous perpetrators.\n\n\n", "id": 110}, "Twitch": {"key": "Twitch", "name": "Twitch", "title": "the Plague Rat", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Twitch\n|alias        = * The Plague Rat\n|render       =  [[File:Twitch Render.png|215px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Plague Rat &lt;small&gt;(Mutated &amp; Sentient)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Zaun]]\n|residence    = [[Zaun]]\n|occupation   = \n|faction      = * [[Zaun]] &lt;small&gt;(Semi-Independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Zac\n|rivals       = Rammus\n|related      = &lt;nowiki/&gt;\n*[http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_11#Giant_Rats_Invade_Southern_Ionia JoJ: 111 - Giant Rats Invade Southern Ionia]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-update-new-breed-plague-rat New Breed of Plague Rat]\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMain=\n&lt;div&gt;TO &quot;H.I.V.E.

Their 'zero tolerance' moral code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike. In combat, this means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender by example. Garen, the valiant warrior who bears the title 'the Might of Demacia', is the paradigm to which these leaders are compared. Thousands of great heroes have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its preeminent rival, [[Noxus]]. It was beneath their mighty banners of war that Garen first met steel with {{ci|Katarina}}, the Sinister Blade. The infantrymen who beheld this event (and survived) commented that it seemed as though the two were locked in a mortal waltz set against a symphony of clashing blades.\n\nGaren, the pride of the Demacian military and the leader of the Dauntless Vanguard, returned from this battle breathless for the first time in his career, though some speculate this was due to reasons other than exhaustion. The plausibility of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again. A paragon of Demacian ethic, Garen never entertained such allegations, for he knew others couldn't understand. Even simply the pursuit of a worthy opponent on the battlefield is, to a true warrior, the reason to rise each morning.

The boy and his Yeti searched far and wide for a place they\u2019d both be welcome, and eventually found a home among the Avarosan.\n\nSometimes bonds of friendship become stronger than even bonds of blood. When those bonds link a fearless boy to a fearsome Yeti, the bond becomes a force to be reckoned with. Given the responsibility of taming a terrifying beast, Nunu forged a friendship where others would have forged chains. Now Nunu and his burly pal Willump are an inseparable pair who combine youthful exuberance and brute strength with the mythical powers of the Yeti to overcome obstacles insurmountable to any ordinary duo.\n\nNunu had only the vaguest memories of his parents or the time before he was part of the reclusive Frostguard tribe. Never welcome among his caretakers, Nunu's wanderlust and compassion often put him at odds with the tribe's elders and the boy frequently dreamed of places far beyond the shadow of the Frostguard citadel. Sometimes he would do more than just dream, much to the frustration of his minders. This was never more apparent than when Nunu was apprenticed to the tribe's beast master and charged with the care of the creatures under his yoke.\n\nThe Frostguard held a menagerie of the [[Freljord|Freljord's]] wildlife at their beck and call, but unique among their collection was the Yeti: an uncommon creature with mystical qualities and raw physical strength. The beastmaster taught Nunu that it was only a lean diet of plants and regular whippings that kept the vicious beast tame, but the more time Nunu spent caring for the creature, the more he learned that the Yeti was no feral monster.\n\nAs he saw his new friend Willump growing weaker and sicker, Nunu began to sneak the Yeti scraps of meat, hoping to restore his health. Day by day, Willump grew stronger and not the slightest bit savage contrary to the beastmaster's claims. Nunu had hopes of convincing him that the Yeti possessed no danger, but it wasn't meant to be. The next time Nunu came to deliver Willump a meal, he found the Yeti's cage shattered,with only a crude drawing inside signaling the Yeti's farewell. Without hesitation, Nunu rushed into the wilderness in search of his friend.\n\nWhen Nunu finally caught up to Willump, he found the Yeti cornered by the beastmaster alongside a group of Frostguard warriors. Afraid that the men would hurt his friend, Nunu threw himself between the Yeti and the beastmaster's lash, but the brutal man would not stay his hand. As the furious beastmaster raised his whip once more, the Yeti swelled up with uncharacteristic fury. Even after so much mistreatment, it wasn't concern for himself but for the boy who'd shown him kindness that finally pushed Willump too far. The Yeti raged and left the man bloodied in the snow.\n\nTerrified by Willump's fury, the remaining Frostguard warriors fled. Nunu realized there was no going back. He yelled at Willump to run before the men returned to kill him, but the Yeti refused to leave the young boy. Nunu was faced with a hard choice: abandon his sole friend and lead a life of captivity with the Frostguard,or strike out into the harsh wilds and leave behind the only home he knew. Nunu chose the only path that made sense. Leaping onto the back of the mighty Yeti, Nunu joined Willump in his great escape. The pair took their first steps into the wide world from which they had been kept for so long.\n\n{{quote|&quot;Willump and I have a whole world to explore.

As the last living practitioner of Wuju, Master Yi has devoted his life to finding able pupils to carry on the legacy of his lost people.\n\nEven before Yi mastered Wuju, he was considered one of the most skilled practitioners of the mystical martial art. He would soon prove his mastery when word of a massive [[Noxus|Noxian]] invasion reached his remote village. Yi swept across the battlefields of [[Ionia]], turning back the tide of Noxus' vast infantry with {{ai|Alpha Strike|Master Yi|swift}} and {{ai|Wuju Style|Master Yi|deadly}} strikes, much to the embarrassment of the Noxian High Command.\n\nRecognizing the threat the Wuju disciples posed to their invasion, the Noxians chose to unleash a nightmarish {{ci|Singed|chemical attack}} on the home of the deadly art. Those who somehow survived the poisonous concoction had their minds twisted beyond repair. Yi's home was left in ruin.\n\nAt the war's conclusion, Yi returned to the grotesque remains of his village. There he became the attack's final casualty. Slain in spirit, if not in body, Yi clung to the only feeling left within his heart: vengeance. Driven only by his desire to punish those who'd destroyed his home, Yi spent years training in seclusion.\n\nHe became a deadlier swordsman than he had ever been, but true mastery of Wuju still eluded him. At the height of Yi's frustration, {{ci|Wukong|a monkey}} of unusually noble bearing interrupted his training.\n\nStanding as straight and tall as a man, the monkey watched and mimicked Yi's movements. Yi shooed the monkey away, but the agile creature took great amusement in turning Yi's own techniques against him.\n\nGradually, Yi felt his anger subside as he sparred with the playful animal, and when the burden of his hatred had fully lifted, he found he had caught the monkey by his tail. Yi then understood that he would never master Wuju so long as he pursued it for vengeance, and as he let go of the monkey, he also released his desire to shed his enemy's blood.\n\nYi thanked the monkey for showing him what he'd been blind to, and was surprised when the creature actually replied. He wished to learn Yi's art of fighting.\n\nIt was an odd request, but through it Yi saw his new path: the way to honor the memory of his lost people was to pass their teachings on to a new generation.\n\n", "id": 11}, "Elise": {"key": "Elise", "name": "Elise", "title": "the Spider Queen", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Elise\n|real_name = Elise Kythera Zaavan\n|alias = \n* The Spider Queen\n* &lt;s&gt;Lady Elise&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|Spiderlings}}\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|render = Elise Render.png\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Shapeshifter)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Immortal Bastion, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* House Zaavan Mistress\n* Artifact Collector\n* {{moi|Vilemaw}}'s High Priestess and Feeder &lt;ref&gt;[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36346739#36346739 kitae on Vilemaw]&lt;/ref&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] [[The Black Rose]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Vilemaw\n|friends = LeBlanc, Vladimir\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/elise?_k=h7d851 Spider Queen]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Beauty is power too, and can strike swifter than any sword.&quot;'' - {{ci|Elise}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nElise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep in the Immortal Bastion of [[Noxus]]. Once she was mortal, the mistress of a once-powerful house, but the bite of a vile {{moi|Vilemaw|spider god}} transformed her into something beautiful, undying, and utterly inhuman. To maintain her eternal youth, Elise preys upon the innocent, and there are few who can resist her seductions.\n\n==Lore==\nThe Lady Elise was born many centuries ago to House Kythera, an old and powerful family of Noxus, and swiftly learned the power of beauty to influence the weak-minded. When she came of age, she plotted to marry the scion of House Zaavan to augment her house's power. The match was opposed by many within Zaavan, but Elise beguiled her intended husband and manipulated her detractors to secure a betrothal.\n\nAs Elise had planned, her influence upon her new husband proved considerable. House Zaavan grew stronger, which in turn saw House Kythera's star rise. Elise's husband was the face of his house, but those in the know understood who truly wielded power. At first, Elise's husband tolerated this, but as the years went by, his discontent festered as he became a light joke among Noxian families.\n\nEventually, his resentment grew ever more rancorous until one night over a typically frosty dinner, he revealed he had tainted her wine with a disfiguring poison. He offered his terms; withdraw from society and stay out of his way as he took up the reins of power and he would give her the antidote. Refuse, and he would watch her die slowly and painfully. With every breath the poison did its evil work, dissolving her flesh and bone from the inside out. Believing he would have the antidote somewhere about his person, Elise palmed a sharp knife and played the role of remorseful wife to the hilt. She wept and begged her husband to forgive her, using every wile in her arsenal to approach without alerting him to her deadly intent. All the while, the poison was wracking her body, discoloring her flesh with grotesque lesions and filling her limbs with agony.\n\nWhen Elise reached her husband, he realized - too late - just how badly he had underestimated her disdain. She leapt upon him and rammed the knife through his heart, twisting the blade slowly as she watched him die. Elise found and drank the antidote, but the damage was done. Her face was monstrously disfigured with grotesque weals and necrotic flesh, like a cadaver given hideous animation.\n\nElise was now mistress of House Zaavan, and such was the nature of Noxian politics that she was lauded for cutting a weakness from the empire. Yet so entwined were her particular notions of beauty and power that she retreated from public life and took to wearing a face-covering veil. Eschewing daylight, and turning away all allies and petitioners from her door, her once powerful house began a slow descent into obscurity. Elise roamed the empty halls of her palace in isolation and became a denizen of darkness, only ever venturing beyond its high walls at night.\n\nOn one of her midnight wanderings, Elise was approached by another veiled woman, who pressed a waxen sigil of a [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] Black Rose into her palm and whispered that {{ci|LeBlanc|the Pale Woman}} would greatly value her talents. Elise pressed on, but as she walked away, the woman's voice echoed after her with the promise of being made whole again. However absurd she told herself it was, vanity and the hope of her beauty being renewed drove Elise to investigate further. She prowled the streets for weeks until she saw [[the Black Rose]] sigil again, etched onto a shadowed archway leading into the catacombs beneath Noxus.\n\nFollowing the hidden sigils brought her to the Black Rose, a secret society where those who dabbled in the darker powers of magic shared hidden knowledge and secrets. Elise became a regular visitor, going unveiled among its members and swiftly establishing a close rapport with the Pale Woman, an agelessly beautiful individual of great power. Elise embraced the society's ways, but always sought the gift she had been promised; her beauty made whole again.\n\nThe Pale Woman spoke of a haunted place known as the [[Shadow Isles]] and a serpent-bladed {{w|athame}} belonging to one of her acolytes who had been slain in the lair of a voracious {{moi|Vilemaw|spider god}}. The dagger was imbued with powerful magic, and if it was returned to her, then she would use its magic to restore Elise's beauty. Elise immediately accepted and led a group of Black Rose devotees to the shunned island, knowing there would be a blood price to pay for such a prize.\n\nElise found a desperate, debt-ridden captain willing to bear her and her fellow pilgrims across the ocean. The ship sailed for weeks until a craggy island loomed from seething banks of black mist. Elise came ashore on a beach of ashen sand and led her followers deep into the island's haunted depths like lambs to the slaughter. Many were stolen away by spiteful wraiths, but half a dozen remained by the time they reached the web-wreathed lair of the Spider God.\n\nA bloated, monstrous creature of chitin and fangs erupted from the darkness and feasted on the screaming men and women. As they died or were swept up in streams of web, Elise saw the dagger the Pale Woman sought - held in the grip of a desiccated corpse. She snatched it up as the Spider God sank its envenomed fangs into her shoulder. Elise fell forward and the blade of the athame pierced her heart, its powerful magic flooding her and mixing with the lethal venom to wreak terrible changes on her body. Elise was transformed as the magically-empowered venom renewed her flesh, transforming it into a form even more beautiful than before. Her scars vanished and her skin became flawless and porcelain smooth, but the god's venom had ambitions of its own. Elise's back writhed with undulant motion as a host of arachnoid legs pushed their way from her flesh.\n\nElise rose, breathless with the agony of her transformation, to find the Spider God looming above her. Shared power flowed between them, and both immediately sensed how they might benefit from this unexpected symbiosis. Elise returned to her ship, untroubled by the island's spirits, and set sail for Noxus. When her ship arrived at the docks in the dead of night, Elise was the only living thing aboard.\n\nElise returned the athame to the leader of the Black Rose, though the Pale Woman warned that the magic maintaining her restored beauty would eventually fade. The two sealed a pact; the Black Rose would provide Elise with acolytes to offer up to the Spider God, and she in turn, would return any artifacts of power she discovered upon the isles.\n\nElise once again took up residence in the neglected halls of House Zaavan, becoming known as a beautiful yet unreachable recluse. None suspected her true nature, yet fanciful rumors cling to her, wild tales of her immortal beauty and a terrifying creature said to lair high in her dilapidated, dust-wreathed palace.\n\nCenturies have passed since her first voyage to the Shadow Isles, and whenever Elise sees streaks of white in her hair or crow's feet at her eyes, she ventures forth to cull easily swayed souls from the Black Rose and set sail for the isle of black mists. None who accompany her ever return, and with each voyage, it is said she is renewed and invigorated, bearing another ancient artifact for the Pale Woman.\n\n;Strand by Silken Strand\nThe weeks spent on the ocean had made Markus feel dizzy and weak, so he was glad to be back on dry land. The path leading from the basalt shore had a slick, oily quality, making it treacherous underfoot. The crooked trees to either side were wretched, blackened husks that wept yellowed sap from where it looked like some panicked animal had clawed them ragged. Soft light shimmered between the trees, dancing like the corpse candles that flickered over marshland and drew unwary souls to their doom. The branches were hung with what looked like canopies of ragged muslin, and it took Markus a moment to realize they were swathes of cobwebs.\n\nWiry bracken clogged the undergrowth on either side of the path, rustling with the motion of unseen creatures shadowing their passage through the forest. Perhaps the rats infesting the ship had followed them. Markus had never caught sight of one, beyond a fleeting glimpse of a swollen, {{ai|Spider Form|Elise|black-furred body}} or the skittering sound of {{ai|Skittering Frenzy|Elise|claws}} on wood. He'd never been able to shake the notion that it sounded as if these rats had a few {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|too many legs}} than any normal rat should have.\n\nThe island's air was heavy with damp, and his finely tailored tunic and boots were sodden with clinging moisture. He held a scented pomander beneath his nose, but it did little to disguise the stench of the island, reminding him of the charnel pits beyond the walls of [[Noxus]] when the winds blew in from the ocean. Thinking back to his homeland, he felt a brief twinge of unease. The revels in the catacombs far beneath the city had been a deliciously illicit thrill, a reward for following the secret symbol of the [[File:Black Rose.png|30px|link=]] black-petaled bloom. Within the darkened sepulchers, he and his fellows gathered as devotees.\n\nWhere ''she'' awaited.\n\nHe looked ahead, hoping for a glimpse of the beguiling woman whose words had brought so many of them to this place. He caught a flash of crimson silk and swaying hips before the mist oozing between the trees obscured his sight of her. He'd thrilled to the sermons of her ancient god, and had been overjoyed when he and the others had been chosen to join her on this pilgrimage. It seemed like a grand adventure when they boarded the heavily laden barque at midnight, under the still gaze of the mute and hooded steersman, but being so far from Noxus had begun to dull his enthusiasm.\n\nMarkus paused and turned to look back along the path. His fellow pilgrims pushed past, like vacant-eyed cattle en route to the slaughterman's hammer. ''What was wrong with them?'' Behind them came the steersman, gliding over the path as though his feet barely touched it. His robes were undulant with motion and suffocating fear flowered in Markus' breast at the thought of being near this repellent figure.\n\nHe turned away, only to find himself face to face with ''her''.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Elise}}... &quot;'' he said, and the breath caught in his throat. He instinctively wanted to push her away and flee this awful place, but the intoxication of her dark beauty overpowered any thought of rejection. His sense of revulsion passed so swiftly he wasn't even sure he'd truly felt it.\n\n''&quot;Markus&quot;'', she said, and the sound of his name on her lips was divine, sending a surge of pleasure down his spine. Her beauty transfixed him, and he savored every detail of her perfect form. Her features were angular and sharp, framed by lustrous crimson hair, like that of a highborn girl he once knew. Full lips and eyes of dark radiance drew him deeper into her web with the promise of raptures yet to come. A cloak of sable, secured by an eight-pronged brooch, mantled her rounded shoulders. It rippled with motion, though there was no wind to stir it.\n\n''&quot;Is something the matter, Markus?&quot;'' she said. Her smoky tones soothed his fear like a balm. ''&quot;I need you to be at peace. You are at peace, aren't you, Markus?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Yes, Elise&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;I am at peace.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Good. It would make me unhappy to know you were not at peace when we are so close.&quot;''\n\nThe thought of displeasing her sent a jolt of panic through Markus and he dropped to the ground. He wrapped his arms around her legs, her limbs slender and alabaster white, smooth and cold to the touch.\n\n''&quot;Anything for you, mistress&quot;'', he said.\n\nShe looked down on him and smiled. For an instant Markus thought he saw something long, thin and glossy shift beneath her cloak. The motion was sickening and unnatural, but he didn't care. She hooked a sharpened, obsidian-black fingernail under his chin and drew him to his feet. A rivulet of blood ran down his neck, but he ignored it as she turned and led him onward.\n\nHe willingly followed, all thoughts save pleasing her vanishing like wind-blown smoke. The trees thinned out and the path ended before a rocky cliff carved with time-weathered symbols that made his eyes sting. A shadowed cave gaped like a vile maw at the base of the cliff, and Markus felt his certainty waver as a sudden sense of dread uncoiled in his gut.\n\nElise beckoned him inside, and he was powerless to resist.\n\nThe interior of the cave was unnaturally dark and stiflingly warm, a clammy, fever heat that reeked like offal swept from a butcher's block. A voice deep inside was screaming at him to run, to get as far from this hideous place as possible, but his traitorous feet carried him still deeper into the cave. A droplet from somewhere high above landed on his cheek and he flinched at the sudden, burning pain of it. He looked up at the cavern roof, seeing pale, grub-like shapes hanging overhead and swaying with frantic, trapped motion. In the translucent surface of the fresh-spun web, a human face screamed in mute horror against the suffocating, silken net.\n\n''&quot;What is this place?&quot;'' he asked, the veils of deceit woven around him falling away.\n\n''&quot;This is my temple, Markus&quot;'', said Elise, reaching up to unfasten the eight-pronged brooch at her shoulder and letting her cloak fall away. ''&quot;This is the lair of the {{moi|Vilemaw|Spider God}}.&quot;''\n\nHer shoulders squirmed as two pairs of slender, chitinous limbs unfolded from the flesh of her back; long, dark and tapering to razored talons. They lifted Elise up as a grotesque, bloated mass shifted in the darkness behind her. Colossal legs heaved its corrupt body forward, the faint light from beyond the cave reflecting on the myriad facets of its eyes.\n\nThe vast spider's bulk was enormous, furred and scabbed with wet, mutant growths. The terror of its nightmarish appearance shattered the last of Elise's hold on Markus, and he fled toward the cave mouth with her cruel laughter ringing in his ears. Ropes of {{ai|Cocoon|Elise|sticky web}} struck the rock beside him. Glutinous strands struck his flailing limbs and his pace slowed as he became more and more entangled. He heard the clicking of clawed limbs in pursuit and wept at the thought of her touching him. Yet more strands of her web snared him as something sharp stabbed his shoulder with astonishing swiftness. Markus fell to his knees, {{ai|Neurotoxin|Elise|paralyzing venom}} spreading through his body and locking him in a prison of his own flesh.\n\nA shadow fell across him and he saw the mute steersman with his arms outstretched. Markus screamed as the steersman's hooded robe collapsed, revealing that this was not a man at all, but a writhing nest of innumerable {{ai|Spider Queen|Elise|spiders}} given the semblance of a man. They fell upon him in their thousands, and his screams were choked to muffled grunts as they crawled into his mouth, clogged his ears and burrowed behind his eyes.\n\nElise swung into view above him, borne aloft by the jointed limbs at her back. She was no longer beautiful, no longer even human. Her features were alight with a ferocious hunger that could never be sated. The looming form of her monstrous spider god lifted Markus from the ground with its razored mandibles.\n\n''&quot;You have to die now, Markus&quot;'', said Elise.\n\n''&quot;Why...?&quot;'' he managed with his last breath.\n\nElise smiled, her mouth now filled with needle-like fangs.\n\n''&quot;So that I can live.&quot;''\n\n", "id": 60}, "Alistar": {"key": "Alistar", "name": "Alistar", "title": "the Minotaur", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Alistar\n|alias = The Minotaur\n|render = Alistar Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[Valoran#Races|Minotaur]]\n|birthplace = [[The Great Barrier]]\n|residence = Unknown\n|occupation = \n|faction = \n* Independent\n|allies = Xin Zhao\n|friends = \n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;If you intend to grab the bull by the horns as a summoner, {{ci|Alistar}} might have something to say about that.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAs the mightiest warrior to ever emerge from the Minotaur tribes of [[the Great Barrier]], Alistar defended his tribe from [[Valoran]]'s many dangers; that is, until the coming of the [[Noxian]] army. Alistar was lured from his village by the machinations of Keiran Darkwill, General Boram Darkwill's youngest son, and commander of the Noxian expeditionary force. When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus's elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds. Only the intervention of some of Noxus's most skilled summoners checked Alistar's rage. Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment of Noxus's wealthy leaders.\n\nAlistar's once noble soul slowly became twisted, and he would have been driven to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and eventually arranged for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]] to fight as a [[champion]], hoping to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope.

He also calls to light things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden\u2014something that has made him very unpopular with Noxus's nobles.

While her fervor drives her to ever-greater feats, it can sometimes lead her astray.\n\nFrom childhood, Katarina displayed a natural gift for combat. As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general, many paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade.\n\nRigorously trained by the finest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking [[Demacia]]n officer.\n\nAs she set to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night.\n\nKatarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nFurious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task.

Those who dare face Mordekaiser in battle risk {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|a horrific curse}}: he enslaves his victims' souls to become instruments of destruction.\n\n==Lore==\nMordekaiser was once mortal, a brutal warlord-king who ruled the lands of eastern [[Valoran]] long before the rise of [[Demacia]] or [[Noxus]]. He waded into battle bedecked in heavy iron armor and slaughtered all who opposed him, crushing them beneath his ensorcelled mace, {{ai|Mace of Spades|Mordekaiser|Nightfall}}.\n\nAs hated as he was feared, his enemies finally rallied to end his dark reign. After a long and bloody day of battle, Mordekaiser met his fate standing atop a mountain of corpses, surrounded by his foes. He laughed even as he died, pierced by arrows, swords and spears, promising his killers that he would come back for them.\n\nHis body was hurled upon an immense pyre amid great celebration from his enemies. While the flames were unable to do more than blacken his armor, Mordekaiser's body was reduced to charred bones.\n\nThe fires burned for days on end, but as they finally died down and the victors moved on, a coterie of sorcerers slunk forward and sifted through the ashes, gathering up Mordekaiser's armor and bones. They bore them away in secret, and on a moonless night they laid the skeleton upon a rune-carved slab and enacted a spell of vile, necromantic sorcery. As their dark magicks reached a crescendo, a shadowy form appeared upon the slab. The deathly shade rose to its feet, leaving the skeleton behind.\n\nIt was a wraith formed of pure darkness, yet its eyes burned with malice. The fire-blackened pieces of armor slammed into place around the shadowy spirit, as if drawn to a powerful lodestone, and the sorcerers dropped to their knees before their risen master. They had been promised great power for their service, but had not foreseen how they were to be rewarded.\n\nWith newfound mastery over the necromantic arts, Mordekaiser gifted the sorcerers with undeath, trapping them between life and death. They became vile liches, living corpses cursed to serve him until the end of time.\n\nOver the next decade Mordekaiser saw all those who had defied him slain. {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|He cursed them}} into eternal servitude, drawing out their souls and forcing them to obey his undying will.\n\nHaving assumed the mantle of the Iron Revenant, Mordekaiser's nightmarish reign of darkness lasted many centuries. Several times he was seemingly slain during this period, yet always he returned, brought back by the power of his soul-bound liches.\n\nMordekaiser's bones were key to his unholy reincarnation, and as the centuries rolled on he became increasingly paranoid about their safety. He constructed a monolithic fortress at the heart of his empire that came to be known as the Immortal Bastion. Locked away at the core of this epic stronghold he hid his remains.\n\nThe Immortal Bastion was eventually besieged by a concentrated alliance of tribes and warbands. During the siege, an unknown thief infiltrated the mighty fortress, bypassing its fiendish defenses to steal Mordekaiser's skull. His skeleton needed to be complete in order for his resurrection to be enacted, yet fearful of their master's wrath, his enslaved liches kept the theft a secret.\n\nOn the walls of the Immortal Bastion, countless enemies fell before Mordekaiser, yet it was not enough to stave off defeat. His fortress was overrun and he was dragged down by sheer weight of numbers. His deadly mace was torn from his grasp and great chains wrapped around his limbs. The booming of his laughter echoed through the darkness - he had no reason not to believe he would be reborn anew, as he had been many times before. The chains binding him were hitched to hulking Basilisks, and with a barked order the immense scaled beasts ripped him apart.\n\nMordekaiser's skull was taken across the sea to the Blessed Isles, a land hidden in mist and legend. The wise adepts of that land knew of Mordekaiser, and of his weakness. They had stolen his skull in order to rid the world of his unholy presence, placing it in a vault deep beneath the ground, secured behind locks and magical wards. Mordekaiser's servants were scattered to the corners of the world, seeking his lost skull, but were always unable to locate it. It seemed Mordekaiser's reign was truly over.\n\nYears rolled into decades, decades to centuries, until a cataclysm was unleashed upon the Blessed Isles. {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King|A king}} whose mind had been ruined by grief and madness unleashed a terrible spell that condemned the isles to darkness, turning them into a twisted realm of the undying - the Shadow Isles. During that great sorcerous explosion, the vaults securing Mordekaiser's skull were torn asunder.\n\nDrawn like moths to a flame, Mordekaiser's liches made their way to the newly born Shadow Isles. They bore with them their master's bones, and digging his skull from the ruins, were finally able to unleash him upon the world once more.\n\nMordekaiser has since carved out his own empire upon the Shadow Isles, enslaving a growing army of the dead. He looks down upon these newly formed undying spirits as a lesser breed, for he chose his path freely, while these others are merely lost souls. Nevertheless, he sees their use; they will be his foot-soldiers in the conflicts to come.\n\nUnlike the lesser spirits, Mordekaiser is not bound by [[the Black Mist]] - he is too powerful for that - yet its baleful energy grants him considerable power. For now at least, the Shadow Isles serves as the perfect place to build his strength.\n\nWhile he consolidates his power, and constantly obsesses over making his bones ever-more secure, Mordekaiser has begun to look across the seas, towards Valoran. He has set his sights on the empires and civilizations that have risen since his absence. In particular, his attention is drawn to the Immortal Bastion, that mighty fortress that now acts as the capital city of the upstart empire called Noxus.\n\nA new era of darkness beckons.\n\n;Shadows of Damnation\n[[The Black Mist]] coiled and twisted like a living creature as it rolled forward to encircle the isolated, grey-stoned castle.\n\nA massive, armored figure walked within the darkness of the Black Mist. His heavy warplate gleamed like oil, and orbs of cruel witchfire burned within his horned helm.\n\nGrass withered underfoot as the armored revenant marched towards the castle's gatehouse. He could see movement on the walls. They knew death had come for them.\n\nHis own name drifted on the wind, whispered in fear:\n\n''{{ci|Mordekaiser}}.''\n\nArrows sliced through the night. Several stuck Mordekaiser, ricocheting from his armor. One sank into the gap between his helm and gorget, but his inexorable approach did not slow.\n\nA heavy iron portcullis barred Mordekaiser's advance. The revenant extended a gauntleted hand and made a wrenching motion in the air. The lattice ironwork screamed in protest as it was twisted out of shape before being hurled contemptuously aside, revealing the heavy oak gate beyond.\n\nWhite hot warding runes burst to life upon the gate, forcing Mordekaiser back half a step. The Black Mist roiled around him, and it was possible now for the defenders to see other forms within it - hateful, shadowy specters that hungered for living souls.\n\nMordekaiser stepped forward, brandishing his immense spiked mace, {{ai|Mace of Spades|Mordekaiser|Nightfall}}. A weapon of dark renown, thousands had fallen before it. With a powerful swing, he slammed the weapon into the oak gate.\n\nThe runes exploded, Mordekaiser's dark sorcery overcoming the petty protective spells of his enemies. The gate smashed inwards, ripped off its hinges.\n\nThe Black Mist flowed through the breach, Mordekaiser striding within it.\n\nThe garrisoned soldiers and men-at-arms waited for him in the courtyard beyond.\n\n''Weaklings all.'' His gaze swept over them as he sought a foe worthy of his attention. His undying gaze settled on a silver-clad knight that stepped out to meet him, sword drawn.\n\n''&quot;Begone, revenant, or I shall see you banished&quot;'', said the knight. ''&quot;This hamlet and its people are under my protection.&quot;''\n\nRising to this threat, a host of specters and translucent warriors manifested in the Black Mist behind their master.\n\n''&quot;This one's soul is mine&quot;'', Mordekaiser said, holding the eager spirits at bay. His voice was deep and sepulchral, the timbre of death itself.\n\nMordekaiser pointed, and {{ai|Siphon of Destruction|Mordekaiser|a cone of malignant unlife}} burst towards the knight.\n\nThe knight's armor shone brightly for a second, then returned to its normal, mundane form, leaving him unharmed by Mordekaiser's necromantic sorcery.\n\n''&quot;[[Demacia]]n steel&quot;'', sneered Mordekaiser. ''&quot;It will not save you.&quot;''\n\nHe stepped forward and brought his spiked mace down toward the knight's skull. The strike was met with a two-handed parry, though the power of it forced the knight to his knees. Mordekaiser towered over him.\n\nThe knight spun away, avoiding Nightfall as it swung toward him in a lethal arc. He sidestepped and sank his blade deep into Mordekaiser's side, biting through the banded links and chain. To a living man, it would have been a mortal blow, but to the armored behemoth, it was as nothing. Mordekaiser backhanded the knight across the side of his head, sending him reeling.\n\nThe Iron Revenant stepped in to end the fight, but the knight turned aside his strike with exquisite skill, and rammed the point of his blade into Mordekaiser's chest with all his strength and weight.\n\nWith a wrench of metal, the blade punched through the breastplate above the heart. There was no resistance from within, as if the suit were hollow.\n\nMordekaiser grabbed the knight by the throat in one giant hand and lifted him off the ground.\n\n''&quot;You thought you could protect these mortals&quot;'', said Mordekaiser. ''&quot;But know that it will be you who slays them.&quot;''\n\nHe squeezed, tightening his grip on the knight's throat. The mortal's feet kicked in the air. Mordekaiser watched closely, eyes burning, as the life drained from the knight. Finally, he dropped the lifeless corpse to the floor.\n\nMordekaiser knelt and placed a hand upon the dead knight's chest. When the armored giant rose, he drew forth {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser|the shade}} of the dead warrior.\n\nThe spirit of the knight looked around it, horror writ in its spectral eyes.\n\n''&quot;Now&quot;'', commanded Mordekaiser, knowing that the shade was powerless to resist him.\n\n''&quot;Kill them all.&quot;''\n\n", "id": 82}, "KogMaw": {"key": "KogMaw", "name": "Kog'Maw", "title": "the Mouth of the Abyss", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Kog'Maw\n|alias = The Mouth of the Abyss\n|render = Kog'Maw Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = [[The Void|Voidborn]] &lt;small&gt;(Unknown Species)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[The Void]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Predator \n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution|Battlecast]] Member {{w|Alternate future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n* &lt;small&gt;([[The Evolution]] {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = Malzahar, Kha'Zix, Cho'Gath\n|rivals = \n|related = [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins Battlecast Army]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;If that's just hungry, I don't want to see angry.&quot;'' - {{ci|Tryndamere}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nWhen the prophet {{ci|Malzahar}} was reborn in [[Icathia]], he was led there by an ominous voice which thereafter anchored itself to his psyche.\n\nFrom within, this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though Malzahar was no longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons.\n\nThis baleful beacon's gentle flicker - now fastened to [[Runeterra]] - drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between spaces which were never meant to meet.\n\nThere amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, {{ci|Kog'Maw}} manifested in [[Valoran]] with unsettling curiosity.

He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\n\nThe earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Protectorate and the [[File:ProfileIcon713 Red Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Magelords. Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped. They braced for inevitable defeat.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words, he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. His presence inspired the desperate warriors. At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies, his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon, the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.\n\n[[File:Aatrox Statuesketch.png|left|180px]]\n\nAatrox vanished after that battle, but the Protectorate army's newfound fury did not. Their surprising triumph led to many more until they were able to finally return home victorious. Their countrymen hailed them as heroes, but though they had saved their entire civilization from destruction, darkness lingered in the mind of each warrior. Something within them had changed. Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.\n\nTales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\n\n", "id": 266}, "Draven": {"key": "Draven", "name": "Draven", "title": "the Glorious Executioner", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Draven\n|alias = \n* The Glorious Executioner\n* Draaaaven\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven|Spinning Axes}}\n|render = Draven Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|residence = Noxus Prime, [[Noxus]]\n|occupation = \n* Executioner\n* &lt;small&gt;(News Reporter {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Noxus Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Noxus]]\n|allies = Draven\n|friends = Darius, Draven\n|rivals = Darius\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The 'best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.&quot;'' - {{ci|Draven}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nUnlike his brother {{ci|Darius}}, victory in battle was never enough for Draven.

There he carved out the celebrity he desired by turning the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle. At Draven's first execution, he shocked onlookers when he ordered the doomed prisoner to run for dear life.

They never succeeded. Rejecting the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright outfits and developed {{ai|Whirling Death|Draven|flashy signature moves}} to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. \n\nAs his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center of attention.

At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of [[the League]]'s first [[summoner]]s. Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.\n\nWhat exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in [[Summoner's Rift]]. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were {{ai|Terrify|Fiddlesticks|driven mad by fear}}, mere husks of men gibbering about {{ai|Crowstorm|Fiddlesticks|crows}} and death.

Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the [[Fields of Justice]], what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown.

He was born among the Rakkor, a warlike people living on the flanks of Mount Targon, and after climbing the mountain's treacherous peak and being deemed worthy, he was chosen to become the earthly incarnation of the celestial Aspect of War. Imbued with inhuman power, he relentlessly seeks the enemies of Targon, leaving only corpses in his wake.\n\n== Lore ==\n\nAtreus was a proud young Rakkoran named after one of the four stars that formed the Warrior constellation in the night sky \u2013 the constellation known to the Rakkor as the Pantheon. While not the fastest or strongest of the young warriors of Mount Targon, nor the most skilled with the bow, spear or blade, Atreus was determined, single-minded, and his endurance was legendary among his peers. Every day before dawn, while the others slept, he rose to run the treacherous paths of Mount Targon, and he was ever the last to leave the training ground at night, his arms leaden from blade-work. \n\nA fierce rivalry developed between Atreus and another young Rakkoran, a boy called Pylas. Born into a line of renowned warriors, Pylas was skillful, strong, and popular. He seemed destined for greatness, and none his age could best him in the fighting circle. Only Atreus refused to back down, pushing himself up from the ground to fight on, bloodied and bruised, even after being knocked down again and again. While this earned Atreus the respect of his grizzled instructors, it gained him the enmity of Pylas, who took Atreus\u2019s unrelenting defiance as a lack of respect. \nAtreus was shunned by his peers and suffered numerous beatings from Pylas and his followers, though he endured it all with stoic resilience. He kept his growing ostracism a secret from his family, knowing it would only cause them pain. \nOn an early winter patrol, a day\u2019s march from their village, the young warriors and their trainers came upon the smoking ruin of a Rakkoran outpost. Blood stained the snow, and bodies lay strewn across the ground. A hasty retreat was ordered, but it was too late\u2026 the enemy was already upon them. \n\nClad in furs and heavy iron armor, the outsiders sprang from beneath the snow, axes flashing in the cold light. None of the young warriors had completed their training, and their superiors were all greybeards, well past their prime, yet several enemies were slain for every one of their own that fell. Nevertheless, the outsiders outnumbered them, and the Rakkor were cut down, one by one. \n\nPylas and Atreus fought back to back, the last of the Rakkor still standing. Both were injured and bleeding. The battle would be over in moments, yet they knew they had to warn the village. Atreus plunged his spear into a barbarian\u2019s throat, while Pylas cut down two more, creating a momentary gap in the circle of enemies. Atreus told Pylas to go, saying that he would hold their enemies off so Pylas could get away. With no time to argue \u2013 Atreus was already charging the enemy \u2013 Pylas ran. \n\nAtreus fought hard, but as a heavy axe slammed into his chest, he finally fell, and slipped into unconsciousness. \nAtreus awoke, not in the celestial afterlife as he had expected, but upon the mountain where he had fallen. The sun had dropped behind the surrounding peaks, and a fresh layer of snow covered him. Numb and barely lucid, he pushed himself to his feet. He picked his way between the bodies of the fallen Rakkor, but all were dead. Worse, Pylas lay some way off, a throwing axe embedded in his back. Word had not reached their village. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-stumbling to Pylas\u2019s side, Atreus found his one-time rival alive, but horribly wounded. Hefting the young warrior to his shoulders, Atreus began the long trek home. Three days later, he stumbled to the outskirts of their village, and finally allowed himself to collapse. \n\nHe awoke to find Pylas watching over him, and his wounds stitched and bound. While Atreus was relieved to find that their village had not been attacked, he was also surprised to learn that neither the Rakkor nor the Solari elders had sent out the Ra-Horak to find and kill the intruders, choosing instead to stay and defend against any possible attack. \n\nIn the months that followed, Atreus and Pylas became close friends. All earlier antagonism forgotten, they threw themselves into their training with renewed vigor and purpose. All the while, Atreus\u2019s resentment toward the Solari order grew. He felt the best way to protect the Rakkor was to actively seek out and destroy their would-be enemies, but the new leader of the Solari\u2019s warriors \u2013 a former member of his own tribe, Leona \u2013 preached a different form of protection, which Atreus felt was weak and passive. \n\nAs with all young Rakkorans, Atreus and Pylas had grown up hearing stories of great heroes climbing to the peak of Mount Targon and being blessed with great power. Having passed the arduous Rakkoran warrior rites together, the pair began to train in earnest toward making the ascent themselves. Atreus hoped to gain the power he would need to seek out and defeat the enemies of the Rakkor himself, since it seemed the Solari were not willing to do so. \nOnly the strongest attempted the climb, and fewer than one in a thousand even glimpsed the peak. Nevertheless, Atreus and Pylas joined a larger group gathered from all the Rakkoran villages scattered around the foothills of the mountain, and began the ascent. As they set off, the sun turned dark as the silver moon passed before it. Some saw this as an ill omen, but Atreus took it as a sign he was on the right path \u2013 that his beliefs about the Solari were correct.\n \nAfter weeks of climbing, the group was half its original size. Some had turned back, while others had been claimed by the mountain, having fallen into crevasses, been buried beneath avalanches, or frozen to death in the night. They were high above the cloud line, and the sky was filled with strange shifting lights and illusions. Still they pressed on. \n\nThe air grew steadily thinner, and the cold ever more bitter as the weeks turned to months. Several climbers stopped to catch their breath, never to move again, their flesh freezing to the mountain. Others, driven insane by the lack of air and exhaustion, threw themselves from the cliffs, falling like stones. One by one, the mountain claimed those who attempted to master it, until only Pylas and Atreus remained. \n\nExhausted, frozen, and their minds addled, the pair made the final ascent to the summit, only to find\u2026 nothing. \nThey saw no fabled city at the peak, nor any sky-warrior heroes waiting to embrace them \u2013 only ice, death, and rocks twisted into strange circular shapes. Pylas collapsed, the last of his strength finally giving out, and Atreus roared his frustration. \n\nKnowing Pylas had not the strength to make the descent, Atreus sat with him, cradling his head in his lap as he watched the life drain from his friend. \n\nThen the heavens opened. The air shimmered like liquid, and a gateway opened before Atreus. Golden light spilled out, warming his face, and a city beyond the veil could be glimpsed \u2013 a place of inconceivable architecture and grandiose vision. A figure stood waiting for him, hand outstretched. \n\nTears of awe ran down Atreus\u2019s face. He would not have left his friend, but as he looked down he saw that Pylas had died in his arms, a beatific smile upon his face. Atreus stood, closed his friend\u2019s eyes, and laid him gently on the melting snow. He stepped forward to meet his guide, walking through the veil of reality to the real Targon. \nMonths passed. On the lower flanks of the mountain, it was assumed Atreus and Pylas had died along with everyone else who had attempted the ascent. They were mourned, but this was nothing unusual, nor was it unexpected. Only once in a generation did someone return with power from the top of the mountain. \n\nIt was at this time that another raiding party of northern barbarians mysteriously appeared on the mountain, almost a year to the day since they had butchered those Rakkorans at the outpost and Atreus\u2019s peers. They attacked a number of isolated villages, slaughtering and pillaging, before pushing on toward a Solari shrine high upon the mountain. The guards there were heavily outnumbered, yet they stood ready to die defending the relics and mystics within. \nAs the enemy marauders closed in, an unnatural, keening wind descended, whipping the snow around in a growing fury. The swirling clouds parted, exposing the full majesty of Mount Targon at the epicenter of the storm. Warriors on both sides struggled to maintain their footing, shielding their eyes against the ice storm as a ghostly, glowing city appeared in the heavens at the mountain\u2019s apex. \n\nThe four stars of the Pantheon constellation pulsed brightly, then turned dark overhead. Simultaneously, the burning light of a falling star appeared within the ethereal city and streaked toward the ground. \n\nIt screamed toward the temple, moving at astonishing speed, and the barbarians prayed to their heathen gods in quivering voices. The streaming light slammed down, striking the ground between the two forces with an earth-shattering impact. \n\nThis was no star, but a warrior mantled in starlight and bearing a gleaming, golden shield and spear of legend. He had landed in a warrior\u2019s crouch, one knee lowered to the ground, and as he looked up at the enemy defiling the lands of Mount Targon, the Rakkorans saw it was Atreus\u2026 and yet not Atreus. The Aspect of the Warrior had infused him, and he was now both mortal and immortal, the incarnation of war made flesh. He was now an avatar of battle. He had become the Pantheon. \n\nHe rose from his crouch, eyes blazing with celestial light, and the enemy knew death had come for them. \nThe battle was over quickly; none could stand against Pantheon. The outsiders\u2019 blood ran from Pantheon\u2019s armor and weapon, leaving them pristine and gleaming with starlight. His enemies defeated, Pantheon marched into the roaring ice storm and disappeared. \n\nAtreus\u2019s family mourned their son and held a funeral for him. While they had suspected he was dead after he had not returned from the expedition, now his demise was confirmed. The Pantheon Aspect had obliterated his personality, memories and emotions. Atreus\u2019s flesh was nothing but a shell inhabited by the supernatural Aspect of War; his mortal soul had joined those of the ancestors in the celestial afterlife.\n \nAtreus was not the first appearance of Pantheon on Runeterra \u2013 there have been others, and there will likely be more. They are not immortal, limited by the human flesh they inhabit, and can be killed, though it takes great effort to do so. Pantheon\u2019s latest appearance has been greatly debated by the elders of the Solari, for his arrival is both a blessing and a curse, as it often heralds a time of darkness yet to come... \n\n", "id": 80}, "XinZhao": {"key": "XinZhao", "name": "Xin Zhao", "title": "the Seneschal of Demacia", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Xin Zhao\n|alias        = * The Seneschal of Demacia\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nXin_Zhao_Render.png|Current\nXin Zhao Viscero Render.png|Young\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown\n|residence    = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation   = * Steward of the Lightshield Dynasty\n* &lt;s&gt;Gladiator&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Demacia_Crest_icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Garen, Sona, Alistar\n|rivals       = \n|related      = \n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n\n''&quot;Death is inevitable; one can only avoid defeat.&quot;''\n\nWhenever Jarvan III, the king of [[Demacia]], delivers one of his rallying speeches from the glinting marble balcony atop the Royal Palace, Xin Zhao is at his side.

It was a gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter won matches, his number of opponents (generally prisoners of war) fought simultaneously would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match. \n\nJarvan II, hearing of this unprecedented feat, infiltrated the arena to offer him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately sentenced him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that a king would risk his own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin Zhao and his 300 opponents. During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This act of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot at his side until the day the king died. \n\nNow in the service of his son, Jarvan III, Xin Zhao continues to fight for his adopted country and to honor the legacy of the man who gave purpose to his life.\n\n", "id": 5}, "AurelionSol": {"key": "AurelionSol", "name": "Aurelion Sol", "title": "The Star Forger", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Aurelion Sol\n|real_name = \n|alias = The Star Forger \n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Center of the Universe|Aurelion Sol|Cosmic Energy}}\n|render = Aurelion Sol Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Sexless|\u2609}} Male\n|race = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Dragon)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Dawn of Time)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Star Forger\n* Cosmic Overlord\n* Servant of the Aspects\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = \n|enemies = Pantheon\n|related = \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAAnY_L4Pp4 Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/aurelion-sol.html Star Forger]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Cower. Worship. Marvel. They are all appropriate responses.&quot;'' - {{ci|Aurelion Sol}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAurelion Sol once graced the vast emptiness of the cosmos with celestial wonders of his own devising. Now, he is forced to wield his awesome power at the behest of a space-faring empire that tricked him into servitude. Desiring a return to his star-forging ways, Aurelion Sol will drag the very stars from the sky, if he must, in order to regain his freedom.\n\n==Lore==\nThe appearance of a comet often portends a period of upheaval and unrest. Under the auspices of such fiery harbingers, it is said that new empires rise, old civilizations fall, and even the stars themselves may tumble from the sky. These theories merely scratch the surface of a far more bizarre truth: that the comet's radiance cloaks a cosmic being of unfathomable power.\n\nThe being now known as Aurelion Sol was already ancient by the time stellar debris first coalesced into worlds. Born in the first breath of creation, he roamed the vast nothingness, seeking to fill a canvas of incalculable breadth with marvels whose twinkling spectra brought him considerable delight and pride.\n\nA celestial dragon is an exotic creature, and as such, Aurelion Sol seldom encountered any equals. As more forms of life emerged to fill the universe, a multitude of primitive eyes gazed up and beheld his work with wonder and breathless pondering. Flattered by this audience of countless worlds, he became fascinated by their fledgling civilizations, who crafted amusingly self-centered philosophies on the nature of his stars.\n\nDesiring a deeper connection with one of the few races he deemed worthy, the cosmic dragon selected the most ambitious species to grace with his presence. These chosen few sought to unravel the secrets of the universe and had already expanded beyond their home planet. Many verses were composed about the day the Star Forger descended to a [[Runeterra|tiny world]] and announced his presence to the [[Mount Targon|Targonians]]. An immense storm of stars filled the skies and twisted into a massive form as marvelous as it was terrifying. Cosmic wonders swirled and twinkled throughout the creature's body. New stars shone brightly, and constellations rearranged at his whim. Appropriately awed by his illuminant powers, the Targonians titled the dragon Aurelion Sol and presented him with a gift as a token of respect: a splendorous crown of star-gems, which he promptly donned. Before long, though, boredom drew Aurelion Sol back to his work in the fertile vastness of space. However, the further from the reach of that tiny world he traveled, the more he felt a grasping at his very essence, pulling him off his path, directing him elsewhere! He could hear voices shouting, commanding, from across the cosmic expanse. The gift he'd received was no gift at all, it seemed.\n\nOutraged, he fought these controlling impulses and attempted to break his bonds by force, only to discover that for each attack against his newfound masters, one of his stars vanished forever from the firmament. A powerful magic now yoked Aurelion Sol, forcing him to wield his powers exclusively for Targon's benefit. He battled chitinous beasts that tore at the fabric of this universe. He clashed with other cosmic entities, some of which he had known since the dawn of time. For millennia, he fought Targon's wars, crushed any threats to its dominance, and helped it forge a star-spanning empire. All of these tasks were a waste of his sublime talents; after all, it was he who birthed light into the universe! Why must he pander to such lowly beings?\n\nAs his past glories slowly vanished from the celestial realm for lack of maintenance, Aurelion Sol resigned himself to never again bask in the warmth of a freshly ignited star. Then, he felt it - a weakening in his unwilling pact. The voices from the crown grew sporadic, clashing, arguing with each other while some fell ominously silent. An unknown catastrophe he could not fathom had thrown off the balance of those who bound him. They were scattered and distracted. Hope crept into his heart.\n\nDriven by the tantalizing possibility of impending freedom, Aurelion Sol arrives on the world where it all began: Runeterra. It is here the balance will finally tip in his favor. And with it, civilizations across the stars shall bear witness to his rebellion and again play audience to his might. All will learn what fate befalls those who strive to steal for themselves the power of a cosmic dragon.\n\n;Twin Dawns\n[[Runeterra|This world]]'s familiar sun still hides below the horizon. Crude and unpolished earth unfurls below. Mountains contort into barriers that stretch like fingers across empty scrub lands. Palaces, or rather, what pass for palaces, fail to loom over anything but the squattest of hills. The curvature of the planet meets the stars with a serenity and grace few of the dwellers below will ever witness. They are so scattered across the globe and grasp so blindly for any sort of understanding that it's no surprise they've been conquered and don't even comprehend their predicament.\n\nThe fiery sheen I've gathered as I {{ai|Comet of Legend|Aurelion Sol|streak}} toward my preordained destination illuminates the world beneath me. Pockets of warring, fearful, rejoicing life tucks itself into any fertile nook it can find below. Oh, how they gaze and point as I streak over their heads. I've heard the names they call me: prophet, comet, monster, god, demon... So many names, all missing the mark.\n\nIn a vast stretch of [[Shurima|desert]], I feel the twinge of familiar magic emanating from the seat of the premiere civilization amongst these savages. Lo and behold, a massive {{ai|Shurima's Legacy|Azir|Sun Disc}} is under construction. The poor enslaved laborers beat their heads and rend their clothes in my wake. Their cruel masters see me, a streaking bolt of fire, as a portent of good omen, no doubt. My passing will be etched in their uncouth pictograms upon common stone, an homage to the great comet, the blessing of the sky-god gracing their holy works and so forth. The Disc's sole purpose is to funnel the sun's majesty into the most 'renowned' of these fleshy humanoids, transforming them into exactly what this planet needs: more insufferable [[Ascended|demigods]]. This effort will undoubtedly backfire. But I suppose they might last a brief while, perhaps a thousand years or so, before they fall and are supplanted by others.\n\nThe desert below fades into the night trailing behind me as I streak onward across lonely steppes, then over rolling brown hills gently flecked with greenery. [[Summoner's Rift|The pastoral scenery]] belies a field spattered with blood and littered with the dead and dying. Survivors hack away at each other with rough-hewn axes and scream battle cries. One side is losing quite badly. [[File:ProfileIcon712 Blue Team.jpg|20px|link=]] Stag skulls rest atop pikes stuck into the soil, next to writhing warriors. The few still on their feet are encircled by soldiers riding great shaggy beasts.\n\nThose defeated, surrounded few see me and valiance seems to surge through their veins. The wounded rise and grasp their axes and bows in a final stand that throws their foes off guard. I don't linger to see the rest of the little clash play out because I've seen this scenario unfold a thousand times: The survivors will scratch my comet likeness onto their cave walls. In a thousand years, their descendants will fly my image on banners and undoubtedly ride into a tediously similar battle. For all their efforts to capture and record history, one ponders why they do not learn from their mistakes. That is a lesson even I have had to suffer.\n\nI leave them to perpetuate their bleak cycle.\n\nMy trajectory reveals more inhabitants. Their collective repertoire of reactions span the typical gamut: pointing, kneeling, sacrificing virgins upon stony altars. They look up and see a comet and never ask what lies beneath the blazing fa\u00e7ade. Instead, they stamp it onto their own self-centered worldviews, muddying the splendor of my visage. The few more advanced life forms - and I use that description loosely - gaze up and jot down my coordinates in scientific almanacs instead of using me as prophecy fodder. It's mildly refreshing, but even their developing notions of intellect seems to indicate I am a regularly appearing phenomenon with a predictable orbit. Oh, the feats they could accomplish if only... Well, no use dwelling on the wasted potential of the simple-minded terrestrial born. It's not entirely their fault. Evolution does seem to have a difficult time gaining traction on this world.\n\nBut alas, the novelty of such infantile antics has worn thin. The grasping energies of my magical bondage have dragged me from one paltry world to another for centuries. Now it has led me back to this familiar and unpleasant rock. The star that floods its surface with light was one of my earliest creations, a confluence wrought of love and radiance. Ah, that cherished moment when she flared to life with colors only her creator could see. How I miss a star's crackling new energy warming my face and trickling through my fingers. Each star gives off a unique energy, precious and reflecting its creator's soul. They are cosmic snowflakes burning in defiance of the infinite dark.\n\nUnfortunately, the memories I long to dwell upon are tainted by betrayal. Yes, this was the place where [[Targon]] lured me into servitude. But now is not the time to linger on past mistakes. Those musty Aspects want me to seal yet another breach... in their name of course.\n\nThen, I see her. This world's imbued warrior is alone at the peak of one of the smaller summits, brandishing {{ai|Spear Shot|Pantheon|a starstone spear}}. She watches me through a veil of annexed flesh, a mere spark masquerading as lightning. A thick braid of auburn hair is draped over her shoulder, falling over a golden breastplate that covers pale, freckled skin. Her eyes, the only bit of her face not shielded by a battle-worn helmet, flash a jarring shade of red.\n\nShe calls herself {{ci|Pantheon}} - the warring fury of Targon incarnate. She is not the first of this world to wear the Pantheon mantle. Nor will she be the last.\n\nHer glittering cape flaps out behind her as she raises her muscled arm and makes a motion like she's pulling on a great chain. The tug on my crudely enchanted tether wrenches me off course, toward the mountain upon which she stands. And she's yelling at me.\n\nShe cries outs with a voice that booms inside my head, transmitted through this insufferable star-gem coronet. All sounds fade as she invades my mind.\n\n''&quot;Dragon!&quot;'' she says, as if I am a weak-winged beast of base orange flame, lucky if it can ignite a tree.\n\n''&quot;Seal their gate!&quot;'' she commands, gesturing to the bottom of a rocky crevasse with her pointy little spear. I don't need to see the violet erosion of reality swirling below. I could smell the festering miasma that poisons this world before I even arrived. I fix my eyes on Pantheon instead. She expects me to fall in line like a dog on its leash. Today will be different, for I've learned from my mistakes.\n\n''&quot;Dragon&quot;'', I purr. ''&quot;Are you sure commanding me with such a low name is wise?&quot;''\n\nPantheon's grip on her spear loosens just enough for her to fumble the weapon for a fraction of a second. She takes a step back, away from me, as if a single stride's distance could protect her from my ire.\n\n''&quot;Seal their gate&quot;'', she says again, barking louder as if perhaps the previous command went unheard. Her volume does little to mask the quiver in her voice. She thrusts her spear toward me, as if such a tiny weapon could pierce me.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever seen an Aspect of Targon shaken. She is not used to having to tell me twice.\n\n''&quot;I will deal with those chittering horrors in due time, dear Pantheon.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Do as you are commanded, dragon&quot;'' this Pantheon shouts, ''&quot;or this world is lost.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This world was lost the moment Targon surrendered itself to arrogance.&quot;''\n\nI feel Pantheon's seething mingle with confusion as she struggles to grab hold of my immaterial reins. She's only just now sensing what I have come to learn. Targon is distracted and does not sense its magic faintly ebbing from my bonds.\n\nPantheon bellows once more, and this time, I cannot resist. The crude enchantment regains sovereignty over my will. I turn my attention toward the source of the breach, nestled in the basin of the once-verdant valley, now strangled with creeping, purple miasma. I sense the [[Void]]born perversions of life tunneling through reality's firmament, sending tides of unseen energy coursing through the aether. They shred the veil that separates nothingness and form with their unwelcome passage.\n\nThey're drawn to me, those multi-eyed, carapaced abominations. They seek to devour me, the greatest of their threats. From the reaches of my mind, I conjure an image of the solar furnaces I kindled, before my fettering, which once ignited the hearts of stars. I lance out {{ai|Voice of Light|Aurelion Sol|beams of pure starfire}} and incinerate wave after wave of those gnashing horrors, driving them backward into their oblique infinity. Smoldering husks rain from the sky. I'm a little surprised they aren't wholly disintegrated, but then again, the Voidborn don't know how things work in this universe.\n\nA pulsing sickness lingers in the air. From the epicenter of the corruption, I feel a will... hungry and indomitable, and far from the typical mindlessness I'm accustomed to from these Voidborn aberrations. The pulsating wound on reality yawns and buckles, distorting and warping all it touches. Whatever exists on the other side is laughing.\n\nPantheon shouts another command at me, but I ignore her words. This anomalous fissure in the universe entrances me. This is not the first of its kind I've had to deal with, but this one feels different, and I can't help but admire the marvelously terrifying manipulation of the barriers between realms. Few beings could fathom its complexities, let alone possess the sheer magnitude of power needed to rend the fabric of existence. In my heart, I know a wound so exquisite could never be orchestrated by scuttling creatures. No. There must be more behind this intrusion. I shudder at the thought of what kind of entity is capable of inducing such a volatile rift. I don\u2019t need Pantheon's barked orders to tell me what do next; her array of requests has always been of a rather limited imagination anyway. She wants me to hurl a star at the rift, as if one can simply cauterize such moldering inter-dimensional abrasions and be done with it.\n\nThese obtuse demigods are my captors?\n\nFine. At least they're not too far off in their 'logic' by thinking a few searing cosmic wonders will remedy this problem. I will play the role of the obedient servant just a little while longer.\n\nI enjoy what I do next, partly because they\u2019ll remember it, partly because it feels good to let a little of the old power loose, but mostly because I wish to remind whatever intelligence that controls this Void incursion that nobody laughs at me in my plane of existence.\n\nThe base elements in the atmosphere rally to my cause, accreting into a plasmic anomaly. The swelling stardust detonates at my unspoken command. The result is {{ai|Starsurge|Aurelion Sol|a dwarf replica}} of one of my majestic glories burning in the depths of space. After all, I can't fling a full-fledged star at this fragile world.\n\nThe young star\u2019s shimmering brilliance flies from my hands. It's joined by two sisters, always by my side. {{ai|Center of the Universe|Aurelion Sol|They careen around me}} in a radiant ballet, their white-hot cores devouring the gathering clouds of dust and matter I draw toward us. We become a storm of stars, the night sky incarnate, a maddening gyre of starfire. I conjure eddies of searing stardust, exhaling a heat so pure and dense it collapses the aura of this world just the tiniest bit, forever marring the planet's curvature. Coruscating strands of stellar flame pirouette from the center of the rift. Gravity melts in undulating waves of color most eyes will never be able to witness. My stars warp matter as more fuel coalesces into their cores, causing them to {{ai|Celestial Expansion|Aurelion Sol|shine brighter, burn hotter}}. The whole spectacle is breathtaking, a cascading dance of blinding light and searing heat so hot that for a fleeting moment, new spectra are birthed into existence. My spine tingles just a little bit at how good it feels.\n\nTrees splinter. Rivers evaporate. The mountain walls of the valley crumble in smoky avalanches. The tireless laborers erecting their Sun Disc, the soldiers taking the hill, the stargazers, the worshipers, the terrified, the doomsday prophets, the hopeless, the rising kings... all those who beheld the streaking comet with selfish eyes witness the ensuing supernova as an early dawn. Across this pitiful globe, my radiance turns darkest night to blinding day. What fictions will they conjure to explain this phenomenon?\n\nEven my Targonian masters have rarely witnessed such a display of my power. Certainly, no terrestrial world has ever born scars as severe as what is left of that once-verdant valley. When I am finished, nothing remains.\n\nNot even this incarnation of Pantheon. I can't say I'll miss her or her mindless barking.\n\nIn the glowing aftermath of my carnage, the smoldering once-mountains collapse into the molten rubble streams now flowing through the valley. This is the scar I have left upon this world. A surge of damning pain shoots through my body, radiating from that infernal crown. I am about to pay.\n\nMy head snaps up, and my eyes drink the bitter sight of a dying star. My hearts clasp shut. My minds reel. An overwhelming sense of despair ricochets through my very soul, emanating from a deep and immediate sorrow, like the pulsing realization you\u2019ve lost something precious and know it's all your fault.\n\nSome curious life forms I met long ago once asked how it was possible for me to remember every star I've created. If only they could feel what it was like to create a single star, they would understand the sheer irrelevance of that question. That's how I know when even one of my darlings winks out from existence, ejecting jets of energy and, with it, the very substance of my own spirit. I see her death knell in the heavens above. She shines brightly one last time in a pyroclasm that momentarily drowns her brothers and sisters. My heart shatters as the heavens are diminished in brutal retribution for turning my power on one of Targon's own.\n\nA sun is the price of a single Pantheon. This is the cost of my unfettered wrath. This is the kind of boorish sorcery I must deal with.\n\nWithin seconds, they have regained control of my reins and call me to a new task. On no other world have I exhibited such a display of freedom, no matter how fleeting it was. What's more is that I have learned from their mistakes. A bit of me is free now, and in time, I will return to this world, tap into this mysterious well of energy and cast off the rest of my tether.\n\nI tune into that essence of war, twisting and contorting within fleshy vessels scattered across the cosmos. It wasn't happy about losing its mortal avatar on this world. Already, a new doomed host has been chosen to transform into the next iteration of Pantheon - a soldier from the [[Rakkor]], a tribe who cling to the base of Targon's mountain, siphoning off its power like barnacles. One day, I shall meet this new incarnation of Pantheon. Perhaps he will learn to find a new weapon and abandon that ludicrous spear. I sense Pantheon's celestial kin, scattered across the cosmos. In a single instance, all of their attention is focused on this world, where one of their earthly Aspects was vaporized by their own weapon. Their confusion is mingled with a growing desperation as they contend with each other to regain their control over me. How I wish I could see their faces.\n\nAs I launch myself from the gravity of this world, this [[Runeterra]], I sense an emotion I have never felt from Targon before.\n\nFear.\n\n", "id": 136}, "LeeSin": {"key": "LeeSin", "name": "Lee Sin", "title": "the Blind Monk", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lee Sin\n|alias = The Blind Monk\n|render = Lee Sin Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Ionia]]\n|residence = Shojin Monastery, [[Ionia]]\n|occupation = \n* Monk\n* &lt;small&gt;(Boxer {{w|Parallel universe (fiction)|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Ionia Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Karma, Udyr\n|rivals = \n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The actions of one may sunder the world, but the efforts of many may rebuild it.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lee Sin}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAs a young teen, Lee Sin was intent on becoming a [[summoner]].

He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner.\n\nHe made amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have become one of the League's greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake.\n\nToo impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor.\n\nA League investigation later revealed that the boy's entire village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual. Lee Sin's talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could never forgive himself.\n\nHe left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set himself ablaze as a protest of the [[Noxus|Noxian]] occupation of [[Ionia]].\n\nHe remained alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for [[Ionia versus Noxus: Rematch|a League match]] wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets.\n\nHailed as a savior, he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated.

[[Noxus|Noxian]] Legions ripped through the land like a serrated knife, their gleaming armor blood-red in the sinking sun. Blazing temples lit the waning daylight, and distant cries of anguish filled the air.\n\nNestled in the foothills of Tevasa Mountain was a village of perhaps a hundred people - but home to no great warriors. Some families fled. Some prayed. Others held their loved ones close and wept. Fifty brave souls prepared to fight. They cleaned the dirt from their pitchforks and bound knives to broom handles.\n\nMounting panic shone in the eyes of every defender; they knew they had no hope. With the dust of the Noxian advance already visible in the distance, there was little to do but make peace with their gods. The sons and daughters of Ionia took deep, steadying breaths of mountain air, gazed into the starry twilight, and waited for the slaughter soon to come.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\n{{ci|Ahri}}'s nine tails swished: a nervous tic. Her sharpened senses warned of danger. Crouched in the shadow of a towering willow she listened, watched, and waited. She had observed the villagers for weeks: watching from afar, but never trusting herself to approach. She heard families talking over dinner, the laughs of women who might have been her sisters, and the games of children. Ahri would listen for hours on end, tearing herself away only when the longing grew too sharp.\n\nThough she had little understanding of nations or politics, instinct alone told her something was very wrong in the world today. Curious, and fearing for the villagers, Ahri sniffed the air. She pinpointed the source of her disquiet, and dashed into the night.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 1.png|center|500px]]\n\nSeven Noxian scouts eased through the brush, pushing ever closer to the mountain. Dark-eyed and wary, the men kept their hands on their weapons as they crept through the settling dusk.\n\nAhri found them in a matter of moments and followed them through the forest. She darted between the trees, suspicion mounting as she observed their movements. Of their mission Ahri could only guess, but she had fought enough battles to know killers when she saw them.\n\nThe squad's captain scanned the undergrowth. Without breaking stride he whispered a brief order to the man at his back, who relayed it to the man at his. Ahri thought nothing of it, and continued her silent pursuit.\n\nSuddenly, seven hands reached for seven arrows.\n\n''&quot;Now!&quot;'' roared the captain. The Noxians loosed as one, and a flurry of hawk-fletched arrows flashed towards Ahri.\n\nShe dived from the bushes as two arrows sliced through her sleeve. Ahri ripped it off and dashed into cover, yellow eyes aflame with shock and fury. She would lose no sleep in killing these men.\n\nAhri opened her palms to the sky, and felt the raw power of her spirit coalesce. Her nine tails fanned out in all directions as she pulled white fire from the air with a snarl. With a flick of her wrist, Ahri summoned {{ai|Fox-Fire|Ahri|three motes of spinning flame}}. She dodged another volley of arrows before leaping for the nearest tree, coiling her tails to spring from its trunk, back towards her assailants. The Noxians scattered as she landed in their midst. The man closest to her thrust a knife, but the blade cut only air. Ahri danced through her foes with {{ai|Spirit Rush|Ahri|blinding speed}}.\n\nThe fiery motes around her engulfed the three nearest men. White flames seared them, but Ahri had more than brute force in her arsenal. She vaulted from tree to tree, rising higher with every bound. She spotted the squad's captain crouched between a tangle of tree roots, his bowstring taut. Given half a chance, Ahri knew he'd put an arrow through her eye. She crept silently to the branches above the captain's shelter and spoke, her soft words laced with beguiling power.\n\n''&quot;Human&quot;'', she whispered. ''&quot;Come to me.&quot;''\n\nThe captain's features went slack. Through no will of his own, he set down his bow and walked from cover. He looked up, eyes wide with desperation and desire.\n\n''&quot;Now climb&quot;'', said Ahri, blowing the man a {{ai|Charm|Ahri|kiss}}.\n\nThe captain, utterly in her thrall, scrambled for footholds on the tree trunk. Ahri summoned {{ai|Orb of Deception|Ahri|a sphere of lambent energy}} to her palm, its innocent appearance belying its vast power. She drew back her arm, allowed herself a vulpine grin, and hurled it downwards.\n\nThe orb streaked through the captain before flying back to Ahri palm, and his smoking body fell to the forest floor with a thud. The remaining scouts fled in terror, but running proved every bit as futile as hiding. Ahri vaulted from branch to branch, tails whirling behind her as she struck two men down with thunderous bolts of energy.\n\nThe last man collapsed in a tangle of limbs, clutching at his broken bones as Ahri landed gracefully beside him. She grabbed the Noxian's throat, and put her face an inch from his.\n\n''&quot;You brought this on yourselves&quot;'', she hissed, and snapped the man's neck with a blast of concussive force.\n\nOnly one task remained.\n\nAhri had no qualms about gaining her humanity by taking it from men who had no use for it. She knelt over the fallen Noxian, feeling his pulse fade. She placed her hands to either side of his face. The light of his {{ai|Essence Theft|Ahri|essence}} flowed from his eyes and mouth, and a thrilling sensation surged through Ahri. His humanity poured into her, and she felt the fox within withdraw with every heartbeat. Her tails curled in pleasure, her expression rapturous.\n\nYet even lost in that glorious sensation, Ahri heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The villagers, hearing the sounds of combat, were coming to investigate. She couldn't let them see her like this, draining what remained of a dying man's life. To their eyes she would seem a terrifying mystery: a damnable half-breed stray, neither human nor beast.\n\nReluctantly, Ahri turned from her feast, seeing shapes moving through the trees and bushes. She recognized the men and women she had watched from afar, remembering the friendship she hoped they might one day share.\n\nBut today was not that day, and Ahri turned to flee into the woods.\n\n[[File:Ahri divider 2.png|center|650px]]\n\n", "id": 103}, "Malzahar": {"key": "Malzahar", "name": "Malzahar", "title": "the Prophet of the Void", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Malzahar\n|alias = The Prophet of the Void\n|weapon_pet = {{ci|Voidling}}\n|render = Malzahar Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Shurima]]\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Icathia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Void Prophet\n* &lt;s&gt;Seer&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Void Crest icon.png|15px|link=]] [[The Void]]\n* The Cult of the Void\n|allies = \n|friends = Kog'Maw\n|enemies = Kassadin\n|related = \n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The land may melt, the sea may swell, the sky may fall... but they will come!&quot;'' - {{ci|Malzahar}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nMany men have gone mad beneath the glare of the [[Shurima]]n sun, but it was during the night's chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity. Malzahar was born a Seer, blessed with the gift of foresight. His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of [[Runeterra]]'s greatest boons, but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind.\n\nIn his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned. For some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding, but with each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\n\nHe ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm. His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as [[Icathia]]. Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained. When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.\n\nBeyond it lain the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods. His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of [[the Void]]. His once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of [[Valoran]] beset by creatures of the Void.\n\nStanding alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees: [[The League of Legends|League of Legends]]. Now infused with the power of the Void itself, Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.\n\n", "id": 90}, "Lissandra": {"key": "Lissandra", "name": "Lissandra", "title": "the Ice Witch", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Lissandra\n|alias = \n* The Ice Witch\n* &lt;s&gt;Seeker Lissandra&lt;/s&gt;\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Iceborn|Lissandra|Dark Ice}}\n|render = Lissandra Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = [[Iceborn]] &lt;small&gt;(Formerly Human)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Rakelstake, [[Freljord]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Ancient Times)&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Frostguard Citadel, [[Freljord]]\n|occupation = \n* Tribal Leader\n|faction = \n* [[File:Freljord Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Freljord]] \n* [[File:Freljord Frostguard.png|15px|link=]] [[Frostguard]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Falsely [[Avarosan]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = Trundle\n|rivals = Brand, Anivia, Udyr, Braum\n|enemies = Ashe, Sejuani\n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/ The Freljord]\n*[[Journey Into the Freljord]]\n*[[Battle for Freljord]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n[[File:Freljord Lissandra.png|center|300px]]\n\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Close your eyes and let the cold take you.&quot;'' - {{ci|Lissandra}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nLissandra's magic twists the pure power of ice into something dark and terrible.

To the terrified denizens of the north, she is known only as 'The Ice Witch'. The truth is much more sinister: Lissandra is a corrupter of nature who plots to unleash an ice age on the world.\n\n==Lore==\n\n[[File:Lissandra True Ice.png|left|100px]]\n\nCenturies ago, Lissandra betrayed her tribe to evil creatures, known as the Frozen [[Watcher]]s, in return for power. That was the last day that warm blood ran through her veins. With her corrupted tribesmen and the strength of the Watchers, she swept across the land like a terrible blizzard. As her empire spread, the world grew colder and ice choked the land. When the Watchers were defeated by ancient heroes, Lissandra did not lose faith and swore to prepare the world for their return.\n\nLissandra worked to purge all knowledge of the Watchers from the world. Using magic to take human form, she masqueraded as numerous seers and elders. Over the course of generations, she rewrote the stories of the [[Freljord]], and so the history of its people changed. Today the fragmented retellings of the Watchers are seen as children's tales. But this deception wasn't enough - Lissandra also needed an army.\n\nShe set her sights on the noble [[File:ProfileIcon Frostguard.png|20px|link=]] Frostguard tribe. Lissandra knew corrupting the Frostguard would take centuries, and so she launched her greatest deception. She murdered and stole the identity of the Frostguard leader. Then she slowly began to warp the tribe's proud traditions. When her human form grew old, she faked her own death and then murdered her successor to steal her identity. With each generation, the Frostguard grew more insular, cruel and twisted. Today, the world still sees them as a noble and peaceful tribe that guards against evil creatures like the Ice Witch. In truth, they now serve the witch and long for the glorious return of the Watchers.\n\nLissandra knows that on that day nations will fall and the world will be reborn in ice.\n\n{{sm2|Freljord- Frostguard Lissandra.ogg}} ''&quot;We are the chosen, destined to receive the gifts of the Watchers.

Clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, she is a living embodiment of the silver moon's power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon's towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to divine her power and purpose in this world.\n\n==Lore==\nDiana was born as her mother and father sheltered from a storm on the unforgiving slopes of Mount Targon. They had travelled from a distant land, drawn by dreams of a mountain they had never seen and the promise of revelation. Exhaustion and blinding stormwinds overwhelmed them on the eastern slopes of the mountain, and there, beneath cold, pitiless moonlight, Diana came into the world as her mother breathed her last.\n\nHunters from the nearby {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|Solari}} Temple found her the next day as the storm abated and the sun reached its zenith, wrapped in bearskin and cradled in the arms of her dead father. They brought her to the temple, where the foundling child was presented to the sun and named Diana. The girl with the sable hair was raised as one of the Solari, a faith that dominated the lands around Mount Targon. Diana became an initiate, and was raised to venerate the sun in all its aspects. She learned the legends of the sun and trained every day with the Ra-Horak, the warrior templars of the Solari.\n\nThe Solari elders taught that all life came from the sun, and that the light of the moon was false, offering no nourishment and crafting shadows in which only creatures of darkness found succor. Yet Diana found moonlight entrancing and beautiful in a way the harsh sun glaring down the mountain could never match. Every night the young girl would wake from dreams of climbing the mountain to sneak from the initiates' dormitories to pick night-blooming flowers and watch freshwater springs turn silver in the moonlight.\n\nAs the years went by, Diana found herself ever at odds with the elders and their teachings. She couldn't help but question all she was told, always suspecting there was more that went unsaid in every teaching, as though what she was being taught was willfully incomplete. As she grew, Diana's sense of isolation only became stronger as childhood friends distanced themselves from the mordant, questioning girl who never quite fit in. At night, watching the silver moon rise over the impossibly distant summit, she felt more and more like an outcast. The urge to climb the mountain's flanks was like an itch that could never be scratched, but everything she had been taught since birth told her the mountain would claim more than just her life should she ever try. Only the most worthy and heroic dared make such an ascent. With every passing day, Diana felt more alone and more certain that some vital aspect of her life remained unfulfilled.\n\nHer first clue as to what that might be came when she was sweeping the temple library as punishment for arguing with one of her elders. A glint of light behind a sagging bookcase drew Diana's eyes, and upon investigation, she discovered the partially burned pages of an ancient manuscript. Diana took the pages and read them beneath the full moon that very night, and what she read unlocked a door into her soul.\n\nDiana learned of an all-but-extinct group known as the Lunari, whose faith saw the moon as a source of life and balance. From what Diana could glean from the fragmentary texts, the Lunari spoke of the eternal cycle - night and day, sun and moon - as essential for universal harmony. This was a revelation to the girl with the sable hair, and as she looked beyond the moonlit temple walls, she saw an elderly woman wrapped in a bearskin cloak trudging up the far path that eventually led to the mountain's summit. The woman's steps were faltering and she leaned on a carved staff of willow to remain upright. She saw Diana and called for help, saying that she had to reach the top of the mountain before morning - an ambition Diana knew was utterly impossible.\n\nDiana's desire to help the woman and climb the mountain warred with everything the Solari taught. The mountain was for the worthy, and Diana had never felt worthy of anything. Again the woman asked for her help, and this time Diana did not hesitate. She scrambled over the walls and took the woman's arm, leading her up the mountain, amazed someone so aged had even made it this far. They climbed for hours, above the clouds and into the chill air where the moon and stars glittered like diamonds. Despite her age, the woman kept climbing, urging Diana onwards when she stumbled or when the air grew thin and cold.\n\nAs the night wore on, Diana lost track of time as the stars wheeled overhead and all but the mountain faded from view. Together, Diana and the woman climbed ever upwards and each time her steps faltered, she drew strength from the pale glow of the moon. Eventually Diana fell to her knees, exhausted and weary beyond imagining, her entire body strained to the limits of exhaustion. When Diana looked up, it was to see that somehow they had reached the mountaintop, a feat that should not have been possible in a single night. The summit was wreathed in cascades of spectral illumination, veils of brilliant light, spirals of vivid color and the glimmering ghost of a vast city of silver and gold hovering in the air.\n\nShe searched for her companion, but the woman was nowhere to be seen - only the bearskin cloak mantling Diana's shoulders suggested she had existed at all. Looking into the light, Diana saw the promise of the emptiness within her being filled, of acceptance and the chance to be part of something greater than she could ever imagine. This was what Diana had sought all her life without truly knowing it, and fresh vitality flowed through her limbs as she rose to her feet. She took a hesitant step towards the incredible vista, her resolve growing stronger with every breath.\n\nThe light surged and Diana screamed as it poured into her, a union with something vast and inhuman, impossibly ancient and powerful. The sensation was painful, but also joyous - a moment or an eternity that was both revelatory and hallucinatory. When the light faded, the sense of loss was an ache like nothing she had known before.\n\nDiana stumbled down the mountain in a fugue state, oblivious to her surroundings, until she found herself before a cleft in the mountainside; a cave mouth that would have been invisible but for the moonlight shadows. Cold and needing shelter for the night, Diana sought refuge within the cave. Inside, the narrow cleft widened into the crumbling ruin of what might once have been a temple or vast audience chamber. Its crumbling walls were painted in faded frescoes depicting warriors of {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|silver}} and {{ii|Locket of the Iron Solari|gold}} fighting back to back against an unending host of [[The Void|grotesque monsters]] as the sky rained comets of searing light.\n\nAt the center of the chamber stood {{ai|Moonfall|Diana|a crescent sword}} and a suit of armor unlike any other; a mail shirt of spun silver rings and wondrously crafted warplate of polished steel.\n\nReflected in the gleam of the armor, Diana saw her once sable hair was now purest white, and a rune shone on her forehead with incandescent light. She recognized the symbol so exquisitely etched into the plates of the armor; the same symbol depicted in the pages of the burned manuscript she had found in the library. This was Diana's moment of truth. She could turn away from this destiny or choose to embrace it.\n\nDiana reached out, and as her fingers touched the cold steel of the armor, her mind exploded with images of lives she had never lived, memories she had never experienced and sensations she had never known. Scraps of ancient history raged like a blizzard in her mind; secret knowledge she but dimly grasped and innumerable futures scattered like wind-blown dust.\n\nWhen the visions faded, Diana saw she was now fully clad in the silver warplate, armor that fitted her as though wrought especially for her. Her mind was still afire with newly acquired knowledge, but much of it remained frustratingly out of reach, like a picture half in shadow, half in light. She was still Diana, but she was also something more, something eternal. Feeling vindicated with this new knowledge, Diana left the mountain cave and made her way unerringly towards the Solari Temple, knowing she had to tell the elders what she had learned.\n\nShe was met at the temple gates by {{ci|Leona}}, the master of the Ra-Horak and the Solari's greatest warrior. Diana was brought before the temple elders, who listened with mounting horror as she told of what she had learned of the Lunari. When she had finished her tale, the elders immediately denounced her as a heretic, a blasphemer and peddler of false gods. For such a heinous crime, only one punishment could suffice; death.\n\nDiana was appalled. How could the elders reject what was so patently true? How could they turn their back on revelations brought from the very summit of the holy mountain? Her fury built at their willful blindness, and {{ai|Pale Cascade|Diana|blazing orbs of silver fire}} spun in the air around her. With a scream of rage-fueled frustration, Diana's sword swept out, and where it struck, {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|silver fire}} burned with killing light. Again and again, Diana lashed out and when her fury ebbed, she saw the carnage she had unleashed. The elders were dead and Leona lay on her back, her armor smoking as though fresh from the forge. Appalled at what she had done, Diana fled the site of the massacre, escaping into the wilds of [[Mount Targon]] as the Solari reeled from the savagery of her attack.\n\nHunted by the warriors of the Ra-Horak, Diana now seeks to piece together the fragmentary memories of the Lunari hidden within her mind. Driven by half-remembered truths and glimpses of ancient knowledge, Diana has only one truth to cling to - that the Lunari and the Solari need not be foes, that there is a greater destiny for her than that of a simple warrior. What her destiny might be is unknown, but Diana will find it, whatever the cost.\n\n;Night's Work\nNight had always been Diana's favorite time, even as a child. It had been that way since she was old enough to scramble over the walls of the Solari temple and watch the moon traverse the vault of stars. She looked up through the dense forest canopy, her violet eyes scanning for the silver moon, but seeing only its diffuse glow through the thick clouds and dark branches.\n\nThe trees were pressing in, black and moss-covered, their branches like crooked limbs reaching for the sky. She could no longer see the path, her route forward obscured by rank weeds and grasping briars. Wind-blown thorns scraped the curved plates of her armor, and Diana closed her eyes as she felt a memory stir within her.\n\nA memory, yes, but not her own. This was something else, something drawn from the fractured recollections of the celestial essence that shared her flesh. When she opened her eyes, a shimmering image of a forest overlaid the close-packed trees before her. She saw the same trees, but from a different time, from when they were young and fruitful and the path between them was dappled with light and edged in wildflowers.\n\nRaised in the harsh environs of [[Mount Targon]], Diana had never seen a forest like this. She knew what she was seeing was an echo of the past, but the scents of honeysuckle and jasmine were as real as anything she had experienced.\n\n''&quot;Thank you&quot;'', she whispered, following the spectral outline of the ancient path.\n\nIt led Diana through overgrown and withered trees that ought to have been long dead. It climbed the slopes of rocky highlands, and passed through stands of twisted pine and wild fir. It crossed tumbling mountain streams and wound its way around sheer slopes before bringing her to a rocky plateau overlooking a vast lake of cold, dark water.\n\nAt the center of the plateau was a circle of towering stones, each carved with looping spirals and curving sigils. On every stone Diana saw the same {{ai|Moonsilver Blade|Diana|rune}} that shimmered upon her forehead and knew she had reached her destination. Her skin tingled with a sense of febrile anticipation, a sensation she had come to associate with wild and dangerous magic. Wary now, she approached the circle, eyes scanning for threats. Diana saw nothing, but she knew something was here, something utterly hostile and yet somehow familiar.\n\nDiana moved to the center of the circle and drew {{ai|Moonfall|Diana|her sword}}. Its crescent blade glittered like diamond in the wan moonlight penetrating the clouds. She knelt with her head bowed, the blade's tip resting on the ground, its quillons at her cheeks.\n\nShe felt them before she saw them.\n\nA sudden drop in pressure. A raw charge to the air. \n\nDiana surged to her feet as the spaces between the stones split apart. The air buckled and a trio of screeching beasts charged her with ferocious speed; ivory flesh, bone-white carapaces of segmented armor and steel talons.\n\nTerrors.\n\nDiana dived beneath a snapping jaw filled with teeth like polished ebony, slashing her sword in an overhead arc that clove the first monster's skull to its heavy shoulders. The creature fell, its flesh instantly unraveling. She rolled to her feet as the others circled like pack hunters, now wary of her gleaming blade. The creature she had killed now resembled a pool of bubbling tar.\n\nThey came at her again, one from each side. Their flesh was already darkening to a bruised purple, hissing in this world's hostile atmosphere. Diana leapt over the leftmost beast and swung her sword in a crescent arc towards its neck plates. She yelled one of the Lunari's holy words and {{ai|Crescent Strike|Diana|incandescent light}} blazed from the blade.\n\nThe beast blew apart from the inside, gobbets of newly-wrought flesh disintegrating before the moonblade's power. She landed and swayed aside from the last beast's attack. Not fast enough. Razored talons punched through the steel of her pauldrons and dragged her around. The beast's chest split apart, revealing a glutinous mass of sense organs and hooked teeth. It bit into the meat of her shoulder and Diana screamed as numbing cold spread from the wound. She spun her sword, holding the grip like a dagger and rammed it into the beast's body. It screeched, relinquishing its hold. Steaming black ichor poured from its ruptured body. Diana spun away, biting down on the pain racing around her body. She held her moonblade out to the side as the clouds began to thin. \n\nThe beast had tasted her blood and hissed with predatory hunger. Its armored form was now entirely gloss black and venomous purple. Bladed arms unfolded and remade themselves in a fan of hooks and talons. Unnatural flesh flowed like wax to seal the awful wound her blade had ripped.\n\nThe essence within Diana surged. It filled her thoughts with undying hatred from a distant epoch. She glimpsed ancient battles so terrible that entire worlds had been lost in the fires of their waging; a war that had almost unmade this very world and still might.\n\nThe creature charged Diana, its body rippling with the raw power of [[The Void|another realm of existence]].\n\nClouds parted and a brilliant shaft of silver speared downwards. Diana's sword drank in the radiance of distant moons and light burned along its edge. She brought it down in an executioner's arc, cleaving plated bone and woven flesh with the power of the night's illumination.\n\nThe beast came apart in an explosive detonation of light, its body utterly unmade by her blow. Its flesh melted into the night, leaving Diana alone on the plateau, her chest heaving with exertion as the power she had joined with on the mountain withdrew to the far reaches of her flesh.\n\nShe blinked away after-images of a city that echoed with emptiness where once it had pulsed with life. Sadness filled her, though she had never known this place, but even as she mourned it, the memory faded and she was Diana again.\n\nThe creatures were gone and the stones of the circle gleamed with threads of silver radiance. Freed from the touch of the hateful place on the other side of the veil, their healing power seeped into the earth. Diana felt it spreading into the landscape, carried through rock and root to the very bones of the world.\n\n''&quot;This night's work is done&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;The way is sealed.&quot;''\n\nShe turned to where the moon's reflection shimmered in the waters of the lake. It beckoned to her, its irresistible pull lodged deep in her soul as it drew her ever onwards.\n\n''&quot;But there is always another night's work&quot;'', said Diana.\n\n", "id": 131}, "Tristana": {"key": "Tristana", "name": "Tristana", "title": "the Yordle Gunner", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Tristana\n|alias        = * The Yordle Gunner\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana|Boomer}}\n* {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana|(Riggle}}{{w|Alternate reality|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Tristana Render.png|link=|250px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = [[Yordle]]\n|birthplace   = [[Bandle City]]\n|residence    = [[Bandle City]]\n|occupation   = * Member of the Bandle Gunners\n* &lt;small&gt;(Dragon Trainer{{w|Alternate reality|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Bandle_City_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Bandle City]]\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Teemo, Rumble\n|rivals       = Tahm Kench\n|related      = * [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/dragon-trainers-field-guide Dragon Trainers Field Guide]}}\n\nGreatness comes in all shapes and sizes, as proven by this diminutive, cannon-wielding [[yordle]].

Originally released a megling champion before uh... they all went away... we\u2019re solidifying Tristana as a yordle while giving her a new model, textures, voicework, ability effects and some targeted kit changes. Yep. Kit changes. Along with number tweaks, Tristana\u2019s {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana|E}} active has gone to join the {{ii|Heart of Gold}} and {{ii|Philosopher's Stone|Philo Stone}} in ye warehouse of olde eqyppmente, and she now has a completely new way to shoot, explode, etc her opponents. Here\u2019s how it works.''\n\n&lt;center&gt;[[File:Explosive Charge.png]] '''''E \u2013 Explosive Charge '''''&lt;/center&gt;\n\n'''''Passive:''' Whenever Tristana kills a unit, her shot explodes, dealing damage to all nearby enemies.''\n\n'''''Active:''' Tristana attaches a charge to a nearby enemy unit or turret. After a few seconds, the charge detonates, dealing damage to the target and all nearby enemies. Attacking the target with basic attacks amps the charge up, making it deal extra damage as it explodes. Tristana can also {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}} onto a target with {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} for extra damage.''\n\n''We grabbed a couple of the champion update guys to go through the update and talk about some of the specific changes we\u2019re implementing.''\n\n;Gameplay notes by Miles 'RiotVesh' Miller\n\n[[File:Tristana VU Screenshots.jpg|thumb|center|500px]]\n\n''Old {{ci|Tristana|Trist}} was a late game powerhouse who didn\u2019t really have clearly defined weaknesses. Her power dipped in the mid game, yeah, but when you look at other super powerful late game carries (think {{ci|Vayne}} or {{ci|Kog'Maw}}), she just didn\u2019t have the same Achilles heel-type glowing red spots for her enemy team to pew pew at. She had insane range and speed with her basic attacks, and even when she did get caught, she had a decent knock back AND a lengthy jump that let her GTFO. Changes were needed, and after deliberating with the rest of the champion update designers, we decided to cement Tristana as a daredevil'' reset carry ''who gets bonuses from {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana|(rocket) jumping}} into fights while removing some of the'' safe strength ''she had in her kit.''\n\n''Now, instead of operating as an uber safe right-clicker, new Tristana\u2019s power is windowed, with huge power spikes when she\u2019s played to meet specific goals. Her basic attack speed still increases per level, but the boost is lower than before. This makes {{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana}} actually important, as she\u2019s not just switching from stupid fast attack speed to soul-crushingly fast attack speed. Her {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}} now deals lower base damage, but can deal way more if she stacks up {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} on her target before landing on their face.''\n\n''Implementing {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} brought about a few interesting new combos, too: now you can plant your explosive charge onto the enemy frontline tank, pump up the charge with a few basic attacks, then knock them into their allies with {{ai|Buster Shot|Tristana}}. A bit like a {{ci|Zilean}} {{ai|Time Bomb|Zilean|time bomb}} and {{ci|Lee Sin}} {{ai|Dragon's Rage|Lee Sin|kick}} in one combo. {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} is pretty central to her playstyle: by landing the ability on the right targets and making smart use of {{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana}}, good Trist players will maximize her new {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana|E}}\u2019s detonation before {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}}ing in to start off her trademark reset rampage.''\n\n;Art notes by [[Michael 'IronStylus' Maurino]]\n\n''{{ci|Tristana}} was one of those older champions who was \u2013 as Vesh has put it \u2013 a bit of a blob. Like {{ci|Twitch}}, she had a limited rig, meaning our animators couldn\u2019t add much in the way of personality to her movement, and she was generally starting to look a bit dated next to the more recent champs. We started looking at Tristana through the champion update lens and knew we wanted to bring in a wholesale change, updating her model, textures, rig, and animations until she felt like a unique part of the yordle family.''\n\n[[File:Tristana Render VU.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n\n''That\u2019s right \u2013 she\u2019s now officially a yordle, too! Working from the standards we set with {{ci|Heimerdinger}}\u2019s update, we knew we wanted to push her proportions so that she'' physically represented ''her character and theme. {{ci|Heimerdinger|Heimer}}\u2019s a genius, so has a bit of a bobblehead and wobbles around as he walks. Tristana, on the other hand, represents the yordle take on a super cannon commando. Her appearance is slightly more feral and nature-themed than before, with wilder eyes and animalistic ears that steer her away from little girl territory and towards yordle status. Tristana\u2019s cannon is now a full expression of her, too, thanks to exaggerated animations that we\u2019ve added to the cannon itself whenever she uses {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}} or {{ai|Buster Shot|Tristana}}.''\n\n[[File:Tristana VU Renders.png|thumb|600px|center]]\n\n''{{ai|Buster Shot|Tristana}} us with your comments and feedback below!''\n\n== Previous Lore ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|\nOld lore=\nPrior to [[V1.0.0.116]]:\n\nThe Megling Commandos are something of a legend in [[Bandle City]]. They have a history that spans centuries, and they remain the oldest [[yordle]] military unit still in service. They are renowned for their courage and bravery, as well as their deadliness and ruthlessness, making them the most respected and feared of all warriors in Bandle City. Legends of Megling, the valiant founder of the commandos, can still be heard whispered throughout [[Valoran]] and it was these legends that most fascinated young Tristana. Since she was a wee child, Tristana wanted nothing more than to become the crack shot that her idol was all those years ago. She trained her entire life until she was old enough to join the military and could attempt to earn the rank of Megling Commando. The senior officers were impressed by her abilities, claiming that Tristana was a natural, and she realized her dream that day as she donned her Megling fatigues. Though her heart lies with her unit, the call to the [[Institute of War]] was greater still and now Tristana honors her tradition and protects her people as a [[champion]] in [[the League of Legends]].\n\n&quot;''Stand very still when she asks you to put an apple on your head!''&quot;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n== Previous Abilities ==\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHide=\n|-|\nShow=\n&lt;gallery captionalign = &quot;center&quot;&gt;\nRapid Fire old.png|Rapid Fire (Old)\nRending Shot.png|Rending Shot\nDraw a Bead.png|'''Draw a Bead''' (Active) \u2013 Tristana aims much more carefully, increasing her attack range but slowing her movement speed.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n== Patch History ==\n{{scroll box|content=\n;[[V6.16]]\n* General\n** {{sbc|Bug Fix:}} '''Rocket Girl Tristana Punk''' chromas no longer use '''Tristana's''' base visual effects.\n\n;[[V5.22]]\n* Stats\n** Base attack damage increased to {{fd|56.96}} from {{fd|51.54}}.\n** Attack damage growth reduced to {{fd|2.41}} from 3.\n* {{ai|Rapid Fire|Tristana}}\n** {{sbc|removed:}} On-hit CDR for {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} cooldown.\n** {{sbc|removed:}} On-hit CDR for Rapid Fire when attacking {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}}.\n** Cooldown reduced to 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 seconds from 20 at all ranks.\n* {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}}\n** Base damage changed to 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 from 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 / 180.\n** {{sbc|removed:}} Damage increase per {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} stacks.\n** {{sbc|new effect:}} Cooldown is also reset if a fully charged {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} hits a champion.\n* {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}}\n** {{sbc|new effect:}} Now detonates instantly on 4th stack.\n** {{sbc|new effect:}} {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}} and {{ai|Buster Shot|Tristana}} can apply stacks.\n** Missile speed increased to 2400 from 1800.\n\n;[[V5.18]]\n* {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}}\n** {{ai|Explosive Charge|Tristana}} no longer fizzles if detonated at 4 stacks by {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}}.

The most remarkable blade style to emerge, however, was the unusual byproduct of foreign intervention. \n\nMaster Lito was a swordsman whose teachings were sought by ruling classes from nearly every city-state. His art was a highly guarded secret, but it was said that {{ai|Hiten Style|Irelia|swords would breathe}} in his grasp.\n\nHe withered unexpectedly from a mysterious disease which baffled the brightest of Runeterran physicians. When he died, he left behind Zelos and Irelia, his son and daughter, and {{ai|Equilibrium Strike|Irelia|a truly unique weapon}}.\n\nZelos became a Sergeant in the Ionian military and left to seek assistance from [[Demacia]] immediately prior to [[Noxus]]' invasion of Ionia. Irelia, charged with the protection of their home until Zelos returned, was alone when Noxian forces struck. The Ionians fought admirably, but soon Ionian blood stained the land beneath the prints of foreign boots.\n\nAt the Great Stand of the Placidium, Ionians prepared for surrender, but were inspired to maintain their resistance when the young Irelia hoisted her father's enormous blade and pledged to hold until her brother returned.\n\nIn the chaos of the ensuing fight, Irelia was cursed with dark Noxian necromancy. As her life ebbed, {{ci|Soraka}}, the Starchild, made a final attempt to anchor Irelia's fading soul. Unwilling to relinquish her home, Irelia rose at the brink of death, and her father's sword lifted in the air alongside her.\n\nIrelia rushed back to the fore, unfazed by the blade's sudden animation. The weapon danced around her effortlessly, cutting down Noxians as they gaped in horror. The decimated invaders were forced to retreat from the Placidium, and Irelia was appointed Ionia's Captain of the Guard for her brave defense of her homeland.\n\n", "id": 39}, "JarvanIV": {"key": "JarvanIV", "name": "Jarvan IV", "title": "the Exemplar of Demacia", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Jarvan IV\n|real_name = Jarvan Lightshield IV\n|alias = \n* The Exemplar of Demacia\n* Prince Jarvan\n|weapon_pet = {{ai|Martial Cadence|Jarvan IV|Retractable Lance}}\n|render = Jarvan IV Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = Demacian Crown Prince\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = Xin Zhao, Lux\n|friends = Garen, Shyvana, Quinn\n|enemies = Swain, Sion, Urgot\n|related = \n* [[Journey Into the Freljord]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;There is only one truth, and you will find it at the point of {{ai|Martial Cadence|Jarvan IV|my lance}}.&quot;'' - {{ci|Jarvan IV}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\n[[File:House Lightshield Crest icon.png|left|175px]]\n\nAs the royal family of [[Demacia]] for centuries, members of the Lightshield line have spent their lives waging war against any who opposed Demacian ethics.\n\nIt is said that every Lightshield is born with anti-[[Noxus|Noxian]] sentiment in his blood, and Jarvan IV is no exception. As his forefathers had before him, he led Demacian troops into bloody engagements with Noxian forces, and on many occasions he has bled alongside wounded allies and fallen comrades.\n\nIn his most crushing defeat, he was outmaneuvered and captured by a Noxian battalion under the command of {{ci|Swain|Jericho Swain}}.

Seeking something that only he understood, he ventured south of [[the Great Barrier]].\n\nHe wasn't heard from again for nearly two years.\n\nAfter many had assumed the worst, he returned to glorious fanfare on the streets of Demacia. His Demacian plates were adorned with the bones and scales of creatures unknown. His eyes bore the wisdom of someone twice his age.

Though many doubted her, Nami had the bravery and determination to take on a dangerous quest when no one else would. Now her people believe she is the {{ai|Tidecaller's Blessing|Nami|Tidecaller}}, a chosen one destined to complete a quest essential to the survival of her entire race.\n\nThe Tidecaller's sacred duty is to acquire a moonstone, a powerful object found only in the towering reaches of the surface world. Her people, the Marai, rely on the moonstone's light to ward off the terrors of the depths. However, the stone's power lasts only one hundred years. Before its light fades, the Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and carry it to the surface. There, on the night of the winter solstice of the hundredth year, the Tidecaller makes a ceremonial exchange with a landwalker bearing a moonstone. By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.\n\nHowever, in Nami's time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller had been found. Without a chosen one to complete the quest, her people would face disaster, but the Marai waited in faith that the Tidecaller would appear. Nami refused to sit idle, insisting that without a Tidecaller to save them, someone had to act. Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured alone into the dangerous depths where she had defeated the Kraken and survived an incident of being eaten by the Megalodon. None expected her to survive, but after six days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand. The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.\n\nWhen Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore. She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive. Nami faced a choice. She knew the surface world only through tale and rumor, but the survival of the Marai depended upon her. Summoning the tide to {{ai|Surging Tides|Nami|bear her ashore}}, Nami began her search for the moonstone and became the first of her kind to explore the world above the ocean. She left her home behind, and vowed not to return until she had completed the Tidecaller's quest.

Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.\n\nFor years, Ionia's southern mountains were plagued by the infamous &quot;Golden Demon&quot;. Throughout the province of Zhyun, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. Armed militias searched the forests, towns hired demon hunters, Wuju masters patrolled the roads - but nothing slowed the beast's grisly work.\n\nIn desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho for help. Upon hearing of the region's plight, Kusho feigned an excuse for why he couldn't help. But a week later the master, his son {{ci|Shen}}, and star apprentice {{ci|Zed}} disguised themselves as merchants and moved to the province. In secret, they visited the countless families emotionally shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for possible connections or patterns to the murders.\n\nTheir investigation took four long years, and left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho's temple, began to struggle with his studies. Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: ''&quot;Good and evil are not truths. They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.&quot;''\n\nDepicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the capture of the &quot;Golden Demon&quot; would be the seventh and final great feat in the illustrious career of Lord Kusho. On the eve of the Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Everyone had assumed only an evil spirit could commit these horrifying crimes, but Kusho had realized the killer was an ordinary man. The famed &quot;Golden Demon&quot; was actually a mere stagehand in Zhyun's traveling theaters and opera houses working under the name {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}}.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 1.png|center]]\n\nWhen they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. Despite the horrors of Jhin's actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and left at Tuula Prison. Shen disagreed, but accepted the emotionless logic of his father's judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.\n\nThough imprisoned in Tuula for many years, the polite and shy Khada Jhin revealed little of himself - even his real name remained a mystery. But while a prisoner, the monks noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, the guards and monks could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations.\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 3.png|center]]\n\nOutside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire's invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation's appetite for bloodshed. The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror.\n\nNow with access to the Kashuri armories' new weapons, and nearly unlimited funds, the scale of Khada Jhin's &quot;performances&quot; has grown. His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia's secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?\n\n[[File:Jhin divider 2.png|center]]\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|II=\n{{ai|Whisper|Jhin|The gun in his hand}} was simply a tool - but a perfectly crafted one. Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: This detail spoke of its creator's pride and confidence. It was not a Piltovian weapon - those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.\n\nHe wiped the gun's stock a fourth time. He couldn't be sure it was clean until he wiped it down four times. Didn't matter that he hadn't used it. Didn't matter that he was only going to stow it in the bag under the bed. He couldn't put it away until he was sure it was clean. And he couldn't be sure it was clean until he had wiped it down four times. It was getting clean though. Four times makes it clean.\n\nIt was clean, and it was wonderful. His new patrons had been generous. But did the finest painters not deserve the finest brushes?\n\nThe scale and precision of the new device made his previous work with blades seem insignificant by comparison. Understanding firearm mechanics had taken him weeks of study, but evolving his chi techniques from blades had taken months.\n\nThe gun held four shots. Each bullet had been infused with magical energy. Each bullet was as perfect as a Lassilan monk's blade. Each bullet was the paint from which his art would flow. Each bullet was a masterpiece. It didn't just cut apart the body. It rearranged it.\n\nThe rehearsal at the mill town had already shown the gun's potential. And his new employers had been pleased with the work's reception.\n\nHe had finished polishing it, but with the gun in his right hand, the temptation was too great. He knew he shouldn't, but he unpacked the black, eel-skin bodysuit. He drew the fingertips of his left hand across the slick surface of the clothes. The feel of the skin's oily surface quickened his breath. He picked up the tight, leather mask, then - unable to help himself - slid it over his face. It covered his right eye and mouth. It constricted his breathing and removed his depth perception...\n\nDelightful.\n\nHe was putting on the shoulder armor when the bells he'd hidden on the steps leading up to his room sounded. He quickly folded up the weapon and removed the mask.\n\n''&quot;Hello?&quot;'' the maid asked through the door. The lilt in her voice hinted to an upbringing far south of this town.\n\n''&quot;You did what I asked?&quot;'' he said.\n\n''&quot;Yes, sir. A white lantern every four yards. A red lantern every sixteen.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I can begin&quot;'', {{ci|Jhin|Khada Jhin}} said as he swung open the door to his room.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened as he exited his room. Jhin was well aware of how he looked. Normally, it elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing, but today was a performance day.\n\nToday, Khada Jhin cut a slender, elegant figure as he walked out with {{ai|Deadly Flourish|Jhin|a cane}}. He was hunched, and his cloak seemed to cover some huge deformity on his shoulder, but a jaunty stride belied this. He forcefully tapped the cane ahead of him as he marched toward the window. He tapped the frame rhythmically - three beats, then a fourth. His gold sparkled, his cream cloak flowed, and his jewels glittered in the sun.\n\n''&quot;What... what is that?&quot;'' the maid asked, indicating Jhin's shoulder.\n\nJhin paused for a moment to study the woman's cherubic face. It was round and perfectly symmetrical. A dull and predictable design. Removed, it would make a terrible mask.\n\n''&quot;It's for {{ai|Curtain Call|Jhin|the crescendo}}, my darling&quot;'', Khada Jhin said.\n\nFrom the inn's window, he had a clear view of the rest of the town in the valley below him. This performance had to be wonderful, but there was still so much work to do. The councilman would be returning this evening - and so far, all of Jhin's plans for tonight seemed... uninspired.\n\n''&quot;I brought some flowers for your room&quot;'', the woman said, walking past him.\n\nHe could have used someone else to place the lanterns. But he didn't. He could have changed clothes before opening his door. But he didn't. Now she had seen Khada Jhin in his finery.\n\nThe inspiration he needed was so obvious now. So preordained. There was never a choice. There was no escaping the Art.\n\nHe would have to make this maid's face... more interesting.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|III=\nThe candied pork glistened on top of the five-flavor broth. The aroma entranced {{ci|Shen}}, but he set aside his spoon. As the waitress left, she smiled and nodded in approval. The fat had yet to melt into the broth. Doubtless, the soup was already excellent, but in a moment, the flavor would be at its peak. Patience.\n\nShen considered the interior of the White Cliffs Inn. It was deceptively simple and rough. The wood weavers had been masters, removing the tree bark and living leaves only where necessary.\n\nThe candle on Shen's table flickered... wrongly. He slid away from the table, retrieving his blades from under his cloak.\n\n''&quot;Your students are as quiet as a pregnant worax&quot;'', Shen said.\n\nAlone and dressed like a merchant, {{ci|Zed}} entered the inn. Brushing past the waitress, he sat down three tables from Shen. Every part of him wanted to {{ai|Shadow Dash|Shen|dash at his foe}}. To avenge his father. But such was not the way of twilight. He calmed himself as he realized the distance was too far... but only by the length of Shen's index finger.\n\nShen looked over at Zed, expecting to see him grin. Instead, his rival sighed. His skin was sallow, and dark folds hung beneath his eyes.\n\n''&quot;Five years, I have waited&quot;'', Shen said.\n\n''&quot;Have I misjudged the distance?&quot;'' Zed asked wearily.\n\n''&quot;Even if my head is cut off, I will still close and strike&quot;'', Shen said, sliding his foot backward and cocking it against the floor. Zed was ten paces and one half of a finger length away.\n\n''&quot;Your path's closer to mine. Your father's ideals were a weakness. Ionia could no longer afford them&quot;'', Zed said. He leaned back in his chair, keeping himself just outside of the range Shen would need to strike a killing blow. ''&quot;I know that's not something I can make you understand. But I will offer you a chance for vengeance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I do not act because of vengeance. You defy the balance. For that, you are damned&quot;'', Shen said as he inched forward to the edge of his chair.\n\n''&quot;{{ci|Jhin|The Golden Demon}} escaped&quot;'', Zed replied.\n\n''&quot;Impossible.&quot;'' But Shen felt a hollowness had caught in his chest.\n\n''&quot;Your father's greatest victory. And now, again, his foolish mercy has tarnished his legacy.&quot;'' Zed shook his head. ''&quot;You know what that... thing is capable of.&quot;'' Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. ''&quot;And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him.&quot;''\n\nShen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.\n\nNow, that monster had returned.\n\nShen put his swords on the table. He looked down at the perfect bowl of soup in front of him. Little droplets of the pork fat's oil shimmered on its surface, but he wasn't hungry anymore.\n\n{{Clr}}\n\n|-|IV=\nThere was still no sign of {{ci|Zed}}. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. {{ci|Jhin}} needed to be careful.\n\nFrom the jetty, Jhin looked back to the foreign ship. The tide had come in, and the ship would be leaving in a few moments. He would have to return soon if he was going to perform in Zaun next month. Risk on top of risk.\n\nHe stopped to check his reflection in a puddle. From the water, a worried, elderly merchant stared back at him. Years of acting practice combined with his martial training had given him total control of his facial muscles. It was a common face, and he had given it an unexceptional expression. When he walked up the hill, Jhin blended easily into the crowd.\n\nHe checked the white lanterns above him, counting the distance. If Zed appeared, he would need them. At the inn on the top of the hill, he glanced at the planters where he had hidden {{ai|Captive Audience|Jhin|traps}}. Sharpened steel blades, shaped like flowers. They protected his escape route in case anything went wrong.\n\nHe thought of how the metal would slice through the crowd and splash the building's freshly painted teal walls with red. It was tempting.\n\nHe was pushing through the crowd when he heard the village elder speaking to {{ci|Shen}}.\n\n''&quot;Why would the demon attack her and the councilmen?&quot;'' the elder asked.\n\nShen, dressed in his blue outfit, didn't answer.\n\nAnother kinkou, a young woman named {{ci|Akali}}, stood beside Shen. She walked to the doorway of the inn.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', Shen said as he blocked her path.\n\n''&quot;What makes you think I'm not ready?&quot;'' Akali asked, annoyed.\n\n''&quot;Because I wasn't when I was your age.&quot;''\n\nAt that moment, a town guard stumbled from the entrance, his face pale and hollow.\n\n''&quot;Her flesh, it was... it was...&quot;'' he said. He took a few steps, then collapsed to the ground in shock.\n\n''&quot;He saw it. He saw the flower!&quot;'' Against the far wall, the tavern's owner laughed. Then he began weeping - his face painted by madness.\n\nThese were not people who would forget seeing Khada Jhin's work.\n\nShen scanned the faces of the onlookers.\n\n''Clever boy'', Jhin thought, before fading into the back of the crowd.\n\nHe checked the rooftops for Zed as he walked back to the ship.\n\nThe work was inescapable. Together or apart, Zed and Shen would chase the clues he had left. They would follow them back to the Blossom Festival. Back to Jyom Pass. And when they became desperate, then they would have to work together again.\n\nIt would be like it had been when they were young. They would huddle together in awe and fear.\n\nOnly then would the great Khada Jhin reveal himself...\n\nAnd his true masterpiece would begin.\n\n", "id": 202}, "Soraka": {"key": "Soraka", "name": "Soraka", "title": "the Starchild", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Soraka\n|alias        = * The Starchild\n|render       = &lt;gallery&gt;\nSoraka Render.png|Current\nSoraka Divine Render.png|Pre-Fall\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender       = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race         = Celestial Being &lt;small&gt;(Fallen)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Ionia|Astral Grove]]\n|residence    = [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Traveling Healer\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Warwick, Karthus\n|related      =\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\nA healer gifted with the magic of the stars, Soraka holds all living creatures close to her heart.

A being of the stars, she healed the wounded and sick that sought her out. One man called {{ci|Warwick}} came to her grove and begged her to heal his wife, who lay lifeless in his arms. His despair touched Soraka's heart. Though it was too late to save his wife, she offered to help heal the pain of his loss. Unwilling to let go of his grief Warwick ran from the grove, but returned over the following days to hear Soraka's guidance. She began to grow attached to the grieving man. One day Warwick told her he had found the men who killed his wife. He believed revenge would heal his pain &amp;ndash; and if he died fighting, he would at least find peace. Though she pleaded with him, Warwick ignored her and left the grove. The voices of the stars warned her not to follow him, but Soraka had to intervene.\n\nShe stepped into the mortal world for the first time, and soon found Warwick desperately fighting a group of men. She tried to heal him, but for every wound she closed, the men inflicted two more. Soraka realized that she would have to fight to save her friend.

She still felt the power of the stars within her, but they no longer offered her guidance. She took comfort in Warwick's safety, gently healing his wounds, but the man she had called her friend slipped a dagger between her ribs. As her blood spilled, Soraka realized he had fooled her, and everything he had done was a complicated ruse. Feeling humiliated and betrayed she called once more on the power of the stars, searing his flesh and cursing his cruelty. He retreated with an agonized howl, leaving Soraka to reflect upon her fate.

The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children playing at being adults. Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that, even at its small stature, it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is such a twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on [[Valoran]].\n\nAs a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world beyond [[Bandle City]]. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the world, a deal with Noxian traders turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of [[Noxus]] for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.\n\nHe eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land.

Like the wind, she is one gust away from terrible destruction.&quot;''&lt;/center&gt;\n\nThere are those sorcerers who give themselves over to the primal powers of nature, forgoing the learned practice of magic. Such a sorceress is Janna, who first learned magic as an orphan growing up amidst the chaos that is the city-state of [[Zaun]]. Janna eked out what living she could on the streets. Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren't enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of {{ai|Zephyr|Janna|air}}. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually overnight, stunning and surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension also changed her physical appearance, giving her an otherworldly look.\n\nSeeking to right the injustice in the world (particularly the insanity that has become the city of Zaun) Janna has brought her talents to [[the League]]. She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state of [[Piltover]] and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there. Janna is also a new favorite of the League's many fans. She is often the center of attention at functions, fan appreciation days, and other celebratory events. There is something untouchable about Janna, however, and her affections can change as quickly as the wind.\n\n", "id": 40}, "Nautilus": {"key": "Nautilus", "name": "Nautilus", "title": "the Titan of the Depths", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Nautilus\n|alias        = * The Titan of the Depths\n|render       = [[File:Nautilus Render.png|link=|280px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace   = [[Bilgewater]]\n|residence    = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Of no fixed abode)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.[[The League of Legends]]---&gt;\n|occupation   = * Wanderer \n* &lt;s&gt;Sailor and ocean diver&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction      = * Independent\n|allies       = \n|friends      = \n|rivals       = Fizz, Nami\n|related      = \n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n&lt;!-- Lore in need of an update due to the League Retcon.---&gt;\nOnce, Nautilus was a sailor commissioned by the [[Institute of War]] to explore the uncharted reaches of the Guardian's Sea. This expedition took him deep into unknown waters where he and his crew found a vast section of the ocean's rich blue waves were replaced by a black, oozing liquid that none of the crew could identify. Though their job was to investigate anything new that they found, no man aboard was willing to brave the murk except Nautilus. Only moments after he donned the hulking diver's suit and climbed over the ship's rail, something lurking in the muck grabbed hold of him. He clung to the side of the ship, but the thing below pulled him fiercely, rocking the entire ship. The other sailors grew afraid and made a terrible decision. As he stared and pled for help, they wrenched his grip free of the rail. He tumbled to the ink, grabbing the anchor in futile desperation. As he sank, he could do nothing but watch as the dark outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.\n\nWhen Nautilus awoke, he was something different. The great iron suit was now somehow part of him, he could not tell where it ended and he began. All the details of his memory were fuzzy and indistinct but one fact remained clear: he was left here, alone in the sunless depths, to die. In his hands he still clutched the anchor that belonged to the men who had condemned him. Having no other purpose, he took this clue and trudged - too heavy to swim or run &amp;ndash; in search of answers. He wandered without direction or sense of passing time in what felt like an eternal dream. By the time he stumbled upon the shores of [[Bilgewater]], he could find no traces of the man he was. No house, no family, no life to which he could return. Terrified sailors who'd heard his tale directed Nautilus back to the Institute, but the [[summoner]]s refused to relinquish the names of the others they commissioned. By then Nautilus had learned about [[the League of Legends]] and there he saw an opportunity to discover and punish those responsible for the time and life he lost.\n\n{{quote|&quot;When lost in utter darkness, there is nothing left but forward.&quot;|'''Nautilus'''}}\n{{clr}}\n", "id": 111}, "Evelynn": {"key": "Evelynn", "name": "Evelynn", "title": "the Widowmaker", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Evelynn\n|alias = \n* The Widowmaker\n* Lady Evelynn\n|render = Evelynn Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female\n|race = Unknown &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Possibly {{w|Succubus}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Unknown &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Shadow Isles]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = Assassin\n|faction = \n* Unknown &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[File:Shadow Isles Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Shadow Isles]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|allies = \n|friends = \n|rivals = Twisted Fate\n|related = &lt;nowiki/&gt;\n*[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shadow-isles#/champion/evelynn?_k=97ncda Widowmaker]\n}}\n", "background": "\nSwift and lethal, {{ci|Evelynn}} is one of the most deadly - and expensive - assassins in all of [[Runeterra]].

What had once been heavy slabs of muscle in years gone by had slowly given way to fat, but he was still a big, intimidating man. His gaze was inscrutable, his eyes having long been replaced with soulless, reflective black lenses.\n\nA pair of heavily augmented bodyguards stood to either side of him. They were the best money could buy, their bodies having been turned into brutal chem-tech weapons by the brilliant, albeit deranged, scientist {{ci|Singed}}.\n\nTakeda's inherent violence and ambition had seen him rise from humble beginnings to become one of [[Zaun]]'s most powerful chem-barons, the infamous rulers of the undercity. Today he planned the downfall of yet another of his rivals.\n\n''&quot;Bring her in, Ortos&quot;'', he said, through a cloud of exhaled smoke.\n\nUnseen chains rattled and pulled taut, and the dark iron doors to his office ground open. Two more bodyguards stood to mute attention outside. One could never be too careful. Takeda had learned that the hard way, as his many scars attested.\n\nTakeda's shaven-headed chamberlain, Ortos, stepped forward, leading a petite figure to the entrance.\n\nShadows clung to her, making it difficult to see her clearly, though Takeda glimpsed a flash of blue-tinged flesh and a pair of {{ai|Agony's Embrace|Evelynn|predator's eyes}} that reflected the chem-fire sconces of his office. He felt an unfamiliar tremor of apprehension at her appearance, but forced it aside. He was one of the most feared men in Zaun. Why should he feel uneasy in his own office?\n\n''&quot;The Lady {{ci|Evelynn}}&quot;'', Ortos announced.\n\nTakeda waved a gloved hand, and Ortos retreated, the doors grinding shut behind him. Evelynn sauntered forward, moving with sublime grace, the heels of her boots echoing sharply.\n\nShe came to a halt on the other side of Takeda's wide desk, and planted her hands on her hips. He could see her more clearly as the shadows retreated to the corners of the room.\n\nHer slender figure was clad in gleaming red leather, and her eyes were yellow and almond-shaped, like those of a cat. A wild mane of crimson hair framed her face, and sharp canines glinted as her lips parted in a sardonic smile.\n\n''&quot;I've been called many things&quot;'', she said, ''&quot;but a lady? That's a new one.&quot;''\n\nTakeda leaned back in his seat, considering her. ''&quot;Around here, most call you the Widowmaker.&quot;''\n\nEvelynn shrugged. ''&quot;At least it's accurate.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I've never married, myself&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;But the one I want you to kill, the Baron Artega Holt, has a wife. Two of them, actually, and a throng of mistresses.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;He sounds perfectly charming. I'm sure they'll miss him dearly&quot;'', purred Evelynn. ''&quot;I shall be glad to make his acquaintance.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Before I commission you, I need some kind of assurance&quot;'', said Takeda. ''&quot;How do I know you are the right one for this job?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You would have me prove myself, like some back-alley cut-throat?&quot;'' she asked, a hint of irritation in her voice. ''&quot;Has it been so long since I stepped foot in Zaun that I really need to audition?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;We hear something of your exploits from time to time. That [[Demacia]]n knight-commander assassinated last year; that was you, wasn't it?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn gave a slow nod. ''&quot;It was.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;And the heir of Clan Kozari, in [[Piltover]] last week?&quot;''\n\nEvelynn's expression hardened.\n\n''&quot;No, that was not me&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;That was the Gray Lady.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Ah&quot;'', mused Takeda. ''&quot;Interesting. Well, I guess it proves that reputations and gossip can never truly be relied upon. I'll trust what I see with my own eyes.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Then I'm afraid this might leave you disappointed&quot;'', hissed Evelynn.\n\nThe blue-skinned assassin took a step back and instantly {{ai|Shadow Walk|Evelynn|disappeared into shadow}}. Takeda's bodyguards tensed, flexing their piston-strengthened limbs in unease. Takeda glanced left and right, trying to discern her location. Nothing. She was simply gone, vanished completely, as if she had been swallowed by the darkness.\n\n''&quot;Not bad&quot;'', he said. He'd heard of her power, of course, but such things are often over-exaggerated. He was pleased to see that in this case, the rumors were true.\n\n{{ai|Ravage|Evelynn|Taloned hands}} grabbed him from behind, blood red nails digging into his flesh as Evelynn emerged from the shadows. She was far stronger than she looked, and forcibly turned his head to expose his thick neck. Her grasp was ice-cold, as if warm blood no longer flowed in her veins, and her fangs were inches from his jugular.\n\nHis guards turned instantly, stepping forward to defend their master, but Takeda raised a hand, stopping them in their tracks. He knew they would have been too slow had she truly wished to end his life.\n\n''&quot;What do you think?&quot;'' breathed Evelynn through bared teeth, her chilled breath caressing his throat. ''&quot;Impressed yet?&quot;''\n\nTakeda snorted.\n\n''&quot;Not bad at all&quot;'', he said. ''&quot;Yes, you will do nicely. Now, let us discuss my offer.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;I hope you can afford me&quot;'', she hissed, tightening her grip, and leaning closer. ''&quot;I don't want you to have wasted my time here.&quot;''\n\nTakeda swallowed uncomfortably. ''&quot;I don't think that will be an issue&quot;'', he said.\n\nEvelynn released him with a shove, and sat on the edge of his table. She stretched like a cat, completely at ease.\n\n''&quot;You haven't yet asked my price&quot;'', she said.\n\n''&quot;Whatever it is, I can pay it.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Money holds no interest to me, Saito&quot;'', she said.\n\nTakeda furrowed his brow. ''&quot;Then what is it you want?&quot;''\n\n''&quot;Much more than you will be willing to give, I'm thinking&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;But I believe you'll come around.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;This is not the way things work here&quot;'', growled Takeda. ''&quot;I own this district. No one makes demands of me.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;You've seen only a fraction of what I can do&quot;'', said Evelynn. She leaned back, smiling. ''&quot;I'm in the perfect position to make a few demands.&quot;''\n\nTakeda said nothing. His body was tense. He opened his mouth to speak but Evelynn interrupted him, holding up a finger.\n\n''&quot;Don't say anything rash, my dear&quot;'', she said. ''&quot;You'd be dead before the words left your lips.&quot;''\n\nTakeda stared at her, frozen in indecision.\n\n''&quot;Very wise&quot;'', Evelynn said, after giving it a moment. She stood, moved back around the desk, and strode toward the door.\n\n''&quot;Artega Holt will be dead before sunup&quot;'', she said, without looking back. ''&quot;I'll be in touch about my first payment.&quot;''\n\n''&quot;'''First''' payment?&quot;'' said Takeda.\n\n''&quot;The first of many&quot;'', she said, pausing to look back at him. ''&quot;You'd be wise to remember that I can strike wherever there is darkness. And Zaun is such a dark place.&quot;''\n\nShe nodded toward the door, raising an eyebrow. Takeda growled an order, and the doors swung open. Before she left, Evelynn gave him a wink.\n\n''&quot;Don't take it too hard&quot;'', she said, as she melded into the darkness. ''&quot;So long as you don't irritate me, this partnership will work out well for us both.&quot;''\n\nTakeda sat alone in silence. After a few minutes, his chamberlain peered into the room.\n\n''&quot;Can I get you anything, my lord?&quot;'' Ortos said.\n\n''&quot;No&quot;'', said Saito Takeda through gritted teeth. He slammed a fist onto his desk. ''&quot;Leave me. All of you, leave me. And stoke the furnace.

One night, when he had drained all the kegs and was left wanting, Gragas was struck by a thought rather than the usual barstool: why couldn't he brew himself something that would finally get him truly drunk? It was then that he vowed to create the ultimate ale.\n\nGragas' quest eventually brought him to the [[Freljord]], where the promise of acquiring the purest arctic water for his recipe led him into uncharted glacial wastes. While lost in an unyielding blizzard, Gragas stumbled upon a great [[howling abyss]]. There he found it: a flawless shard of ice unlike anything he had ever seen. Not only did this unmelting shard imbue his lager with incredible properties, but it also had a handy side effect - it kept the mixture chilled at the perfect serving temperature.\n\nUnder the spell of his new concoction, Gragas headed for civilization, eager to share the fermented fruits of his labor. As fate would have it, the first gathering to catch Gragas' bleary eyes would shape the future of the Freljord. He blundered into a deteriorating negotiation between two tribes discussing an alliance with {{ci|Ashe}}. Though Ashe welcomed a break in the tension, the other warriors bristled at the intrusion and hurled insults at the drunken oaf. True to his nature, Gragas replied with {{ai|Body Slam|Gragas|a diplomatic headbutt}}, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.\n\nWhen the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas' brew. Although strife was averted and Gragas hailed a hero, he still had not achieved his dream of drunken blissfulness. So once more, he set off to wander the tundra in search of ingredients for [[Runeterra]]'s perfect pint.\n\n", "id": 79}, "Zed": {"key": "Zed", "name": "Zed", "title": "the Master of Shadows", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Zed\n|alias        = * The Master of Shadows\n|weapon_pet   = * {{ai|Razor Shuriken|Zed}}\n* {{ai|Death Mark|Zed|Shadow Blades}}\n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Death Mark|Zed|(Plasma Cut 2250R Dual &quot;Strikers&quot;}}{{w|Alternative future|*)}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render       = [[File:Zed Render.png|link=|290px]]\n|gender       = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race         = Human\n|birthplace   = Unknown &lt;small&gt;(Possibly [[Ionia]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|residence    = [[Ionia|Kinkou Monastery]], [[Ionia]]\n|occupation   = * Master of The Order of the Shadow \n*&lt;small&gt;(PROJECT Initiative member{{w|Alternative future|*}})&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction      = * [[File:Ionia_Crest_icon.png|15px|link=]] [[Ionia]]\n* The Order of the Shadow\n|allies       = \n|friends      = Syndra\n|rivals       = Shen, Akali, Kennen\n|enemies      = Gangplank, Jhin\n|related = [[PROJECT]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n== Lore ==\n{{cbi|Zed}} is the first ninja in 200 years to unlock the ancient, forbidden ways.

Only one other student appeared to be '''Zed's''' equal - the master's son, {{cbi|Shen}}. It seemed '''Zed''' could never win the favor of the master, as every match between the rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he found an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, '''Zed''' knew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden.

By banishing his former student, the master had doomed '''Zed''' to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced path. The old man implored '''Zed''' to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his followers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard '''Zed''' cry out in pain. Mysteriously, he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at {{cbis|Shen}} feet.

But even the sheriff of Piltover cannot deny that Vi is an invaluable asset in the fight against crime.\n\nAs a child growing up in the lawless outskirts of Piltover, Vi learned to rob and cheat to get by. Stealing and stripping hextech hardware gave her the skills of a master mechanic, while life on the streets taught her self-reliance. When she was six, a ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.\n\nVi's attitude changed when a raid on a mining facility went bad. She was forced to decide between fleeing with her crew or trying to save the innocent mine workers from a collapsed tunnel. Vi chose to play the hero. While searching for a way to free the mine workers from the rubble, she discovered a damaged robotic mining rig. Improvising, she wrenched off its huge fists and modified them into makeshift hextech gauntlets. Fitting the heavy weapons to her tiny hands, the young girl flexed her arm and threw a powered punch at the rubble. The force of the blow blasted away the rock. With the workers free to escape, Vi fled the scene.\n\nAfter that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals. As the years went by, Vi modified and improved her hextech fists, allowing her to bust up heists and snatch loot with ease. Eventually, word of her notoriety reached Caitlyn, the famed Sheriff of Piltover. Rather than seek Vi's arrest, Caitlyn offered the criminal a way to pay her debt to society: work for the law in Piltover. Vi laughed. To her, a job that let her beat up crooks without forcing her to run from the cops sounded perfect. She immediately accepted. Caitlyn now struggles to keep Vi in line, and Vi treats Caitlyn's orders as mere suggestions, but when they work together, they are feared by all lawbreakers in Piltover.\n\n{{quote|&quot;It's a shame.

Lulu's imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to [[the Glade]], the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods.\n\nThere the rigid properties of the outside world - things like {{ai|Wild Growth|Lulu|size}} and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place. She quickly lost track of time.\n\nHer life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were 'only pretend', and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal.\n\nLulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she'd learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away.\n\nLulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily {{ai|Whimsy|Lulu|changing}} them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn't appreciate her efforts.\n\nWhen the [[yordle]]s insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.\n\n", "id": 117}, "Taric": {"key": "Taric", "name": "Taric", "title": "the Shield of Valoran", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Taric\n|alias =\n* The Shield of Valoran\n* Oathbreaker\n* The Protector\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Bravado|Taric}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/KYpEU8rj-tarics-new-splash?comment=00010003 Reav3 confirms Taric wields a three-pronged mace]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[File:Bastion Buff.png|20px|link=]] Bastion\n|render = Taric Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human &lt;small&gt;(Magically Altered)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = [[Demacia]]\n|residence = [[Mount Targon]] &lt;small&gt;(No Fixed Abode)&lt;/small&gt;\n|occupation = \n* Celestial Aspect &lt;small&gt;(Protection)&lt;/small&gt;\n* &lt;s&gt;Demacian Knight&lt;/s&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Mount Targon Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Mount Targon]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Semi-independent)&lt;/small&gt;\n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Garen, Skarner, Sona\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/taric-comic/ The Ascent]\n* [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/mount-targon/taric.html Shield of Valoran]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;The best weapons are beautiful.&quot;'' - {{ci|Taric}}&lt;/center&gt;\n\nTaric is the Aspect of the Protector, wielding incredible power as [[Runeterra]]'s guardian of life, love, and beauty. Shamed by a dereliction of duty and exiled from his homeland [[Demacia]], Taric ascended [[Mount Targon]] to find redemption, only to discover a higher calling among the stars. Imbued with the might of ancient Targon, the Shield of Valoran now stands ever vigilant against the insidious corruption of [[the Void]].\n\n==Lore==\nExpected to serve as a stalwart guardian of Demacia, Taric's life was meant to be the model of focused, selfless dedication to the ideals of king and country. Though he always saw himself as a protector, he never felt the need to limit or define whom and what he protected - be it an ideal, a piece of art, or a stranger's life. Each could be considered worthy. Each could be seen as beautiful.\n\nMost of Taric's contemporaries were focused on the martial principles of battle (things that came naturally and effortlessly to him) The young warrior was drawn instead to the fragile wonders that give life meaning, not endless brutish contests for flag or crown.\n\nThis was a potentially treasonous philosophy, especially for one of Taric's standing and role within the Demacian military hierarchy, but he chose to dedicate himself to understanding the simple truths of love, beauty, and life, so he could become their champion. Admired by all, Taric used his disarming manner and innate warmth to charm his way past most obstacles, and on the rare occasion they failed, his skill with {{ai|Bravado|Taric|hammer}} and sword could be counted on to settle the matter.\n\nAs his quest for understanding broadened, Taric would miss combat training to wander the forest in search of a glimpse of a rare animal, neglect parade drills to sit in a tavern and listen to a bard's hauntingly simple ballad, and skip regimental meetings to take horseback rides to observe the silver cloak of night settle across the countryside. Taric knew that, in his own way, he was training in a manner just as dedicated and focused as his fellow Demacians, but it wasn't seen that way by his superiors.\n\nTaric's casual nature, disregard for orders, and disinterest in his patriotic calling finally put him at odds with nearly everyone in authority - his family, his king, and especially his long-time friend {{ci|Garen}}. And while the commoners saw Taric as a charming rogue, Garen recognized him for what he truly was - a man with the potential to become one of Demacia's greatest heroes. The fact that Taric seemed to be thumbing his nose at his destiny as well as his country enraged Garen.\n\nEventually, even his former friend could no longer protect him, and Taric's military career started to crumble. Demotion after demotion pushed Taric further from Demacia's heart, until, at last, he found himself commanding a small squad of lowly recruits assigned to guard an inconsequential ruined fortress out in the borderland wilds. After weeks spent standing in the rain and mud as ordered, and with no threat evident, Taric decided to let his men sleep while he wandered to a nearby temple to take in its cyclopean architecture.\n\nAs morning lit up the temple's overgrown cloisters, Taric finally decided to head back and check on his men. He was greeted by a scene of carnage. His troops had been butchered in their sleep, their corpses bearing the jagged hallmarks of the Void's monstrous predators.\n\nTaric had failed his men, his country, and most painfully, his self-avowed mission to protect life.\n\nReturning to Demacia in shame, Taric was stripped of his rank and sentenced by Garen to endure 'the Crown of Stone', a ceremony that demanded a dishonored soldier ascend Mount Targon, known to all as a death sentence, as few mortals had ever survived the climb.\n\nAnd while the Crown of Stone was traditionally used by the dishonored to simply flee Demacia and make a new life in exile, Taric decided to actually atone for his mistake and set out for the towering spire of Mount Targon.\n\nThe ascent nearly claimed him, body and soul, numerous times, but Taric pushed past the pain, past the memories of his mistake, the ghosts of his dead men, and other tests inflicted upon him by the mountain.\n\nAs he approached the summit, Taric was challenged by a seemingly neverending myriad of conflicting realities, each warped existence offering a new, horrifying vision. Taric experienced the infinite fates that could befall those who had no one to protect them in their times of crisis. He saw the Alabaster Library engulfed in pitch and flame, and still he dashed into the roiling inferno to retrieve the poetry of Tung. He screamed in rage as the [[File:ProfileIcon Frostguard.png|20px|link=]] Frostguard ran the last dreamstag off a blind cliff, and then leapt into the abyss himself in a desperate attempt to save it. Before the ebon gates of [[Noxus]], Taric slumped to his knees at the sight of Garen's shattered body chained aloft as a warning. Between Taric and his friend stood the sum total of Noxus' might. And yet still, without hesitation, Taric raised his [[File:Bastion Buff.png|20px|link=]] shield and drove all before him. Claiming Garen from the gates, the young warrior marched toward Demacia, heavy with his burden, knowing full well that his return would ensure his execution. As he walked, Taric looked upward - and the blood-strewn fields of Noxus gave way to the star-filled expanse above Mount Targon.\n\nHis trials complete, and freed from all illusion, Taric found himself at the pinnacle of the mountain, and he was not alone.\n\nBefore him, cut from the sackcloth of night itself, stood something wearing the shape of a man. Its features composed from the pinpoints of stars, Taric was struck by the odd familiarity of its nature.\n\nIts voice spoke in a thousand whispers that cut through Taric like a mountain wind. Though he heard no recognizable words, he understood the figure's intent with utter clarity.\n\nIt called itself 'the Protector'.\n\nImpressed by Taric's steadfast resolve, the otherworldly being deemed the fallen Demacian hero a worthy avatar, {{ai|Cosmic Radiance|Taric|imbuing him}} with its ethereal powers. The Protector spoke of the truths Taric had known his entire life, and of the mantle that he had unknowingly been preparing for with every decision that brought him to the top of the mountain.\n\nAs the Protector's whispers faded, Taric received a final warning: He would stand as the Shield of Valoran, but crashing against him would be a wave of howling madness, an ocean of gnashing teeth intent on consuming all, a squalid horror born of the Void.\n\nReborn with power and purpose, Taric gladly accepted the seemingly impossible challenge and now dedicates himself to his sworn duty - as the steadfast guardian of an entire world.\n\n;Uninvited Guest\nI look out across the once-verdant field, now scarred and ruined by the toil of battle.\n\nThe loss of life will be immense, but I cannot save those who seek their own destruction. All those sons, all those fathers, all those futures lost. [[Demacia]]ns and [[Noxus|Noxians]], ever at each other's throats, magnetically drawn to one another by something lesser than both.\n\nPlenty of defenders exist for their lofty ideals, and they all stand in my way, almost gleefully slaughtering themselves over a scrap of land, with no idea of its true importance. Two armies entwined, both committed to their ruinous dance.\n\nI could try to reason with them, ask them to move their brawl elsewhere, but my former countrymen now see me as something between a traitor and a wrathful god, and the Noxians... well, the Noxians have always been short on patience.\n\nMy usual weapons - wit, charm, and warmth - are useless in this cauldron of desperation. So I push aside those who would slow me, and wade into those who would stop me. Every kind of horror one soul can inflict on another rages around me as I near my goal.\n\nAnd there, dead center of the roiling fury of battle, the blaze of color calls to me - a delicate life about to be snuffed out amid the mud- and gore-covered boots. Standing bravely, unbowed by the thudding dullness of the armored brutes around it, its beauty rings out like a single crystal bell. It is the last flower of its kind. If it dies, no more shall bloom. I can not allow it to perish.\n\nThe two opposing commanders pause in their combat as I approach, an uninvited guest at their last moments. They turn to me, suddenly allied in their outrage at my intrusion.\n\nI stand at the very eye of the two armies, seemingly inviting the cold embrace of death from all sides. But unlike all those who are now taking wary steps toward me, their sword hands trembling, I know why I fight.\n\n;The Ascent\n\n: ''An exiled soldier ascends Mount Targon to find redemption, only to discover a higher calling.''\n\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\n01=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr01.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|02=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr02.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|03=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr03.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|04=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr04.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|05=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr05.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|06=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr06.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|07=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr07.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|08=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr08.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|09=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr09.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|10=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr10.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|11=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr11.jpg|center|700px]]\n|-|12=\n[[File:Taric ASC pr12.jpg|center|700px]]\n\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\n", "id": 44}, "Quinn": {"key": "Quinn", "name": "Quinn", "title": "Demacia's Wings", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Quinn and Valor\n|alias = Demacia's Wings\n|weapon_pet = \n* {{ai|Harrier|Quinn|Crossbow}} &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* {{ai|Blinding Assault|Quinn|Claws}} &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = Quinn Valor Render.png\n|gender = {{w|Female|\u2640}} Female &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n{{w|Male|\u2642}} Male &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|race = \n* Human &lt;small&gt;(Quinn)&lt;/small&gt;\n* Demacian Eagle &lt;small&gt;(Valor)&lt;/small&gt;\n|birthplace = Demacian Rural Town, [[Demacia]]\n|residence = Demacian Capital, [[Demacia]]\n|occupation = Demacian Elite Ranger Team\n|faction = \n* [[File:Demacia Crest icon.png|20px|link=]] [[Demacia]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Jarvan IV\n|rivals = Talon\n|related = [[Journey into the Freljord]]\n}}\n", "background": "\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n\n00=\n&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Most soldiers only rely on their weapons.

The pair's unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents blind and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: not one, but two [[Demacia]]n legends.\n\nAs a young girl, Quinn shared a hunger for adventure with her twin brother. They dreamed of becoming knights, but lived a quiet, humble life in the rural borderlands of Demacia. Together they imagined triumphant battles in faraway lands, seizing glory for their king and slaying foes in the name of Demacian justice. When daydreams alone could no longer satisfy their warrior souls, they embarked on daring wilderness adventures in search of true danger. One such quest turned to tragedy when a terrible accident claimed her brother's life. Overcome with grief, Quinn abandoned her dreams of knighthood.\n\nOn the anniversary of her loss, Quinn gathered the courage to return to the scene of the tragedy. To her surprise, she found a wounded Demacian eagle at the site of her brother's death - a rare and beautiful bird long believed extinct. Quinn nursed the fledgling back to health, and as they grew up together, a deep bond formed between the two. She saw the same quality in her newfound friend that had lived within her brother, and so she gave him the name 'Valor'. The pair found strength in each other, and together they pursued the dream she had once abandoned.\n\nThe Demacian army had never seen heroes like Quinn and Valor. Their deadly skills quickly set them apart from their rank-and-file peers, but many still had their doubts. How could a common-born girl, even with such a powerful creature at her side, forego years of military training? Quinn and Valor proved themselves on one critical mission, tracking down a [[Noxus|Noxian]] assassin who had evaded an entire Demacian battalion. When they brought him to justice, they finally earned the admiration and respect of their nation. The two now serve as living, fighting icons of Demacian strength and perseverance.

Deep within the winding dungeons that honeycomb the earth beneath its dark, meandering streets lies the real underbelly of this sprawling metropolis, a haven for all manner of malevolence.\n\nAmongst the cults, covens, and secret societies that call this labyrinth their home, LeBlanc, the Deceiver, presides over [[the Black Rose]], a remnant from a lost, yet similarly unscrupulous time in Noxian history. Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government.\n\nIn those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power. While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus.\n\nWhen raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance.\n\nWhen LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: [[the League of Legends]].\n\n", "id": 7}, "Ezreal": {"key": "Ezreal", "name": "Ezreal", "title": "the Prodigal Explorer", "meta": "{{Champion bio|Ezreal\n|alias = \n* The Prodigal Explorer\n* Grandmaster Explorer\n* Professor Lyte's Nephew\n|weapon_pet = \n* &lt;small&gt;{{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal|(PEARL}} {{w|Alternative future|* )}}&lt;/small&gt;\n|render = \n&lt;gallery&gt;\nEzreal Render.png|Current\nEzreal Explorer Render.png|Explorer\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n|gender = {{w|Male|\u2642}} Male\n|race = Human\n|birthplace = [[Piltover]]\n|residence = [[Piltover]]\n|occupation = \n* Cartographer\n* Piltover Grandmaster Explorer\n* &lt;small&gt;(Pulsefire Warrior {{w|Alternative future|*}} )&lt;/small&gt;\n|faction = \n* [[File:Piltover Crest icon.png|18px|link=]] [[Piltover]]\n|allies = \n|friends = Lux, Jayce, Caitlyn, Vi\n|rivals = \n|related = \n* [http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/pulsefire-ezreal/en.html Pulsefire Armory]\n* [[An Ancient Mystery In Runeterra]]\n* [http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html# Shurima]\n* [[Arcade]]\n}}\n", "background": "\nThe intrepid young adventurer {{ci|Ezreal}} has explored some of the most remote and abandoned locations on [[Runeterra]].
